   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rohan Jotwani (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/almostdoc_ro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@almostdoc_ro&lt;/a&gt;), an MD/MBA Candidate at the Tufts School of Medicine, posted a great response on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medstro.com/posts/808&quot;&gt;Medstro&lt;/a&gt; to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/05/fixingthematch.html&quot;&gt;original post about “fixing the match”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I respectfully disagree with some points made in the article, although the article is very well-written and thought-provoking. Within the context that we are currently facing a shortage of physicians and the gap will widen in the future, &lt;strong&gt;I think the solution lies in increasing the number of residency spots/federal funding for GME&lt;/strong&gt; (check out &lt;a href=&quot;savegme.org&quot;&gt;savegme.org&lt;/a&gt; for more data on this) and potentially breaking up certain specialities’ monopoly over capped spots, not decreasing the number of medical school spots overall. I also think it wouldn’t matter if we limited med school admissions anyway because folks would turn to foreign medical schools, which would likely welcome more candidates, given their business model. Also, I think &lt;strong&gt;having the algorithm weed out certain applicants based on their numerical stats for the competitive residencies robs our medical system of physicians that offer traits which can’t be quantified into an algorithm.&lt;/strong&gt; Hopefully most of us would agree that standardized tests are not a perfect indication of future potential in just about any profession and giving more power to it is the opposite approach I would take to fixing the NRMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heres-my-response&quot;&gt;Here’s my response:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohan, you make some strong points. Numbers don’t lie, although the forces shaping their evolution may not be transparent or understandable. Increasing federal funding for GME would likely help, but it inevitably leads to the question of where this extra funding comes from, and healthcare spending as a whole. I don’t know much about this topic though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate on a point I made in my blog post (but perhaps not explicitly), I hypothesize some dissatisfaction with the NRMP stems from a mismatch between expectations and reality. The underlying problem is having more applicants than spots. I agree that the # of foreign medical graduates would probably increase in response to decreased US medical school slots, but it is reasonable to think this would increase the fraction of US medical school graduates who successfully match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeding out applicants: decades of research suggests objective data should trump non-quantifiable traits if the goal is to predict future performance. I strongly recommend Daniel Kahneman’s work, which, as an MD/MBA you should find both fascinating and relevant. For most scenarios, simple correlative algorithms utilizing objective data are actually superior predictors of complex phenomena (especially longitudinal, i.e. 5-year survival) compared to multicomponent models or expert review. In fact, when experts modify simple algorithms based on their subjective experience, predictive accuracy often declines due to cognitive bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I agree with you - standardized tests such as our board exams are far from perfect. An objectively superior (but rather disliked) approach is the MMI, which spreads subjective bias among several observers. Let me elaborate: when I say “numerical stats”, I don’t mean board scores and GPA. I refer to a consistent and objective method of assessing scholarly productivity, professionalism, perseverance, social interaction. This system has yet to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we both agree there exist several domains that are not captured in exam scores that may be predictive for future performance in medicine. This challenge is not unique to the NMRP, and extends to all of medical education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyfaithho&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@amyfaithho&lt;/a&gt; which spurred this interesting conversation can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/04/15/how-a-nobel-economist-ruined-the-residency-matching-system-for-newly-minted-m-d-s/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clinicians are frustrated by problems that require technological solutions. Engineers, entrepreneurs, and makers build cool stuff, but have no clue what problems are clinically relevant. Finally, it can be difficult to get all of these people in the same room at
the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;salons-fix-these-problems-in-three-key-ways&quot;&gt;Salons fix these problems in three key ways:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We highlight local innovation resources, centers, and institutions. At Salon 3, the VP of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjm.com/cardiomems&quot;&gt;CardioMEMS&lt;/a&gt; gave a guest talk about his work. 
CardioMEMS was recently acquired by St. Jude Medical with an up-front investment of $60M and the exclusive option of acquiring the company
 for an additional $375M given the completion of certain commercialization milestones. Read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaycaplan.com/2010/09/14/cardiomems-an-earn-out-with-a-twist/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Announcing the 1st Life Sciences Regional I-Corps Program at Georgia Tech</title>
   <link href="erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/05/19/icorplifescience.html"/>
   <updated>2014-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/05/19/icorplifescience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you a student or faculty member in healthcare or the life sciences interested in commercializing your technology? This Fall, get ready to apply for a Life Sciences Regional I-Corps Program at Georgia Tech, organized by your friendly neighborhood VentureLab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December I attended the final pitches of UCSF’s Lean Launchpad for Life Sciences &amp;amp; Healthcare, run by Steve Blank. I was blown away by how much progress the teams made in just a few weeks. The evening reinforced my belief that customer discovery, business acumen, and entrepreneurial spirit could transform innovation in academic medicine. My new mission was clear: to bring the Lean LaunchPad for Life Sciences back to Atlanta, where we have amazing substrate for medical innovation with Emory &amp;amp; Georgia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Jenny, a postdoctoral fellow and entrepreneur in the course, helped me snag Steve’s phone number. I called him, explained how awesome the Lean Launchpad concept was, and shared how Atlanta was perfect for it. His response – “Yeah, let’s do it! Let me know how I can help” – was refreshing, and so … Silicon Valley. I was used to academic administrators and faculty telling me reasons why my idea was not feasible. He directed me to Keith McGreggor, director of GT’s VentureLab and NSF iCorps instructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a chat with Harold Solomon (friend, mentor, and Forge supporter), as well as Ravi Bellamkonda, Professor and Chair of BME at Georgia Tech. Everyone loved the idea. In fact, they were already considering something similar, given the explosion of entrepreneurial interest in healthcare. Actually, I didn’t do much except remind them how awesome this could be. And now it’s happening this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dates&quot;&gt;Dates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sept 10, 11, 12: 7 am - 9 pm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sept 16, 23, 30, October 7, 14, 21: 11 am – 5 pm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;October 28, 29: 7am – 6pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need three people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurial lead – usually a student&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business mentor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#098;&amp;#114;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#100;&amp;#121;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#097;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#108;&amp;#064;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#098;&amp;#046;&amp;#103;&amp;#097;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;Brandy Nagel&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fixing the NRMP match</title>
   <link href="erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/05/04/fixingthematch.html"/>
   <updated>2014-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/05/04/fixingthematch</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amy Ho outlined the flaws of the NMRP match. Her bottom line is pointed:
&amp;gt;This system is highly wasteful. It incurs massive costs for hospitals and students through the interview process, precludes contract negotiations that could optimize value for both parties and results in depressed wages for young physicians. Additionally, it incurs significant opportunity cost in trading interviews for educational senior year curricula, causes undue duress for applicants and their families and contributes to decreased quality of care in physicians unsatisfied with results of the Match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her argument is compelling, I want to add some thoughts geared towards solutions. I believe technology offers tangible ways to improve these problems. I encourage readers to think of how they would tackle these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s go:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Medical education today is nothing like it was 60 years ago. Today, many specialties have more US medical graduates than residency positions, and international medical graduates and physicians reapplying for residency also compete in the match. Medical schools continue to increase, as have the birth of osteopathic schools and Caribbean schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oversimplified solution: cut the number of students accepted to medical school and reduce medical school class size. Medical student tuition does not contribute to the majority of academic medical center income. I don’t have a citation handy, but I think the majority of funding is actually research-oriented. Anyways, Johns Hopkins is tightening the belt on PhD programs. Academic science suffers a similar but not fully congruent problem; there are too many PhDs doing multiple postdocs who cannot find faculty positions. The solution is economically obvious, but socially and mechanistically challenging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This year, 5.6% of US allopathic (MD) seniors did not match, and 22.3% of US osteopathic (DO) seniors did not match. On the whole, 25.0% of applicants in the NRMP Match did not match – with a 25% unemployment rate, how successful is the Match, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests the match algorithm is not robust. I would need to know more about the overall data for unmatched applicants. My understanding is these applicants tend to apply to highly competitive specialities like dermatology, plastic surgery, and urology – with unrealistic expectations and less than competitive applications.The system should incorporate safeguards based on objective, historical information. For example, say 95% (or 99% or 99.9%) of applicants with a Step 1 score of X, Step 2 score of Y, overall grades of Z, and Q number of publications do not match in neurosurgery. The system should simply not allow that applicant to apply to that specialty. Other metrics such as type of school and degree (MD, DO, dual degree, US, foreign) could be incorporated in a regression analysis model that profiles applicants, and compares them to profiles of successful candidates at different programs for different specialties. Some might find this too harsh; perhaps the system can merely warn applicants if they are truly not competitive for a given program before they pour time and money down the drain. Analogy: if Tinder warned you that you were too ugly, it could save everyone time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With a 15% tax rate, $7,470.76 becomes $8,789.13 in pre-tax income. With 34,270 active applicants in the Match in 2014, $302 million is wasted annually, in the setting of tight graduate medical education funding, increasing student debt and decreasing physician reimbursement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, I respect these back-of-the envelope calculations. Let me try my own. The average debt of indebted MD graduates of the class of 2013 was $169,901. $8,789.13 is %5.2 of overall medical school debt, which is a small overall fraction. My classmates love eating at nice restaurants such as the Spence, buying expensive clothes, and watching 3D Imax movies instead of illegally bittorrenting. To them, debt is debt. However, $300 million cumulatively is nothing to sneeze at. Be that as it may, a world without a match would still require interviews and travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: coordinate group travel, housing, and meals to save tremendous costs. Divide interviews into a quarter system and organize regionally. Usually, this is left to the applicants, and few programs actively coordinate with each other to save students money and time. But vacation-planning services are already abundant online. One plane ticket to the West Coast, with shared housing and ground transportation among several candidates, could knock out 3-5 interviews for the price of 1-2 “typical” interviews done separately. In the first quarter, 25% of applicants interview in the West region, 25% in the Northeast, 25% in the Southeast, and 25% in the NW and Midwest. In the second quarter, the applicant pool rotates to the next region. You might think it sounds insane to use software to force people to decide where to go, when. Oh, wait. Actually, all this does is formalize what already happens but in a more efficient and controlled manner. The challenge lies in aligning incentives. Med students save money, while NRMP and residency programs spend it to make this happen. That is a critical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dual degrees (MD/JD, MD/MBA, MD/MPH) are ever-increasing and many applicants will bring additional value to their hospital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not see data to support this claim, but I also lack any data to support a counter-argument. I can see how MD/MBAs in executive positions might bring $ value through enacting economically beneficial policies / financial restructuring, and how the other dual-degrees bring insight from different fields. However, this value is hard to quantify in dollars. I do know that MD/PhDs in academic faculty positions that focus on research or trained in a “cognitive” or diagnostic specialty make less income in salary than their counterparts who only have MDs and perform procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Match translates into thousands of physicians training in an undesired specialty, in an undesired city and in an undesired situation split from their families. These physicians, lives forced by the Match, cannot be assumed to perform at the same quality as those that matched into their ‘dream job’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of this population, do they end up leaving the profession prematurely?  Are their career trajectories as successful? Are their satisfaction rates the same? What about their suicide rates, addiction rates and wellness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues suggest profoundly important topics of research. If we can’t find the results of these studies today online, they need to be done soon. To motivate change in policy, we need data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic demands insight from thinkers who possess a rigorous understanding of behavioral economics, finance, and systems engineering. But I also think it demands attention from everyone else, especially from rising young physicians who will inherit positions of authority, and the responsibility to enact meaningful change more than any other stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How can academia encourage a culture of technology commercialization?</title>
   <link href="erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/05/01/academiatechcommercialization.html"/>
   <updated>2014-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/05/01/academiatechcommercialization</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The American Physician Scientists Association 10th annual meeting featured a Policy Panel with leaders in device development, entrepreneurship, and FDA/governmental oversight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin Burke, DO&lt;/strong&gt; - Professor of Medicine and Director of the Heart Rhythm Center, University of Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larissa Lapteva, MD, MHS&lt;/strong&gt; – Medical Officer, Rare Diseases Program, Office of New Drugs, CDER, FDA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lex Van Der Ploeg, PhD&lt;/strong&gt; – Chief Science Officer, Rhythm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked the following question via Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What can academic institutions do to encourage a culture of technology commercialization? How can students explore these opportunities while still honing rigorous basic science skills during their PhD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists answered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin Burke:&lt;/strong&gt; Training investigators to be able to effectively communicate the idea to those in the technology transfer office at their institution and be able to negotiate the next steps. However, there is often difficulty in developing personal relationships with those working in the technology transfer office due to high turnover rate. The easiest route to more familiarize oneself is through a mentor who has significant experience dealing with technology transfer, whether that is your own mentor or finding someone outside of your immediate laboratory personnel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lex Van Der Ploeg:&lt;/strong&gt; Thinking ahead about how to develop a product while doing the research. One way is through mentoring from the technology transfer office, which can be achieved by asking them to be involved in your research team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larissa Laptera:&lt;/strong&gt; At the governmental policy level, try to promote collaborations between researchers, technology transfer businesses, and industry for pre-competitive space that focuses on outcomes and endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student Thoughts: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider working with your graduate student body leadership to advocate for a research commercialization course, where they can cover topics such as the process of getting a patent submitted to when it is approved, negotiations, what the technology transfer will need from you, and how they can be involved early in the research process in terms of considerations you need when designing experiments so if results are positive they can be taken to the next step more easily. This has been achieved at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider asking your technology transfer office to link with bioscience business programs that offer seminars and webinars where students can earn a certificate after participating.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider asking a faculty with significant experience dealing with technology transfer to be on your thesis committee and specifically ask them to provide that perspective regarding the design and implementation of your experiments and extracurriculars available locally and nationally to become more familiar with the technology transfer process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many technology transfer offices hire postdocs and so consider talking with them to learn more about the kind of work they do and the internship possibilities during and right after graduate school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Five culture lessons academic medicine must learn from Silicon Valley</title>
   <link href="erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/04/21/5lessonsfromsiliconvalley.html"/>
   <updated>2014-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>erikreinertsen.github.io/2014/04/21/5lessonsfromsiliconvalley</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Advances in technology, ranging from vaccines to MRI, have always driven the greatest revolutions in healthcare. Progress in molecularly targeted therapeutics, silencing RNA, and gene therapy is promising, but digital health is perhaps the fastest growing frontier in medicine. In 2013, digital health funding rose more than 39%, exceeding $1.9B with 195 venture deals ($2M+). However, this rapid growth is from tech diffusing into medicine, and not the other way around. Clinicians continue to use antiquated electronic medical record (EMR) systems with clunky interfaces on ten-year old Dell desktops. Why is medicine so slow to change, especially in academia?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason is that physicians are not trained to innovate. Memorizing protocols, doses, and clinical signs are arguably more useful for everyday practice on the wards compared to exercising immense creativity. In fact, creativity can potentially harm patients. Suppose a statistically powered trial suggests a treatment improves outcomes. Objective data should trump individual preference and creativity at the point of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, physicians are not totally non-innovative. Academic clinicians advance clinical care through new knowledge. Research intends to translate creative questions into useful answers about diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, senior physicians often deviate from evidence-based treatment guidelines based on their experience, but the privilege of creativity must be earned after decades of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic scientists also struggle to efficiently innovate. Translating inventions from the lab to the market is notoriously complex and slow in the university setting. Offices of technology transfer earn poor reputations due to inept staff and leadership that lack genuine startup experience. Universities – especially small- and mid-size institutions – may lack strong role models on the faculty who have achieved both academic and commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter issue highlights one of the most dangerous cultural barriers to innovation in academia: the misalignment between activities which advance technology innovation, and those which further academic careers. Basic science departments may look more favorably upon a publication in a reputable journal versus a filed patent, or the successful raising of seed funding for a startup. Fortunately, the perception of technology innovation is becoming more positive in academia. These ethical, cultural, and institutional issues in academia stand in stark difference to Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley is home to many of the world’s largest technology corporations, as well as thousands of small startups. Ever since HP and Apple started in a garage, countless other entrepreneurs have adopted the belief that anything is possible, and anyone can change the world with their idea. Furthermore, the immense financial success of tech companies in Silicon Valley has fueled an innovation cycle by attracting investors and more visionary entrepreneurs. The drive, excitement, marathon work ethic, and intensity of startup culture is at first glance comparable to medicine, but there are far more billion-dollar deals and TED-talk meetups in Palo Alto than any hospital. What makes this place so special? Accenture recently published a report where they found the workplace culture of Silicon Valley consists of &lt;em&gt;five seemingly contradictory characteristics&lt;/em&gt; that have helped the region produce life-changing innovations and many of the world’s most successful companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laid back – yet driven for speed.&lt;/strong&gt; Congenial and laid-back, people will nevertheless work intensely for long hours for their companies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committed – yet independent.&lt;/strong&gt; People are deeply committed to their work and their colleagues. Yet they are essentially “free agents” with no strong allegiance to one company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive – yet cooperative.&lt;/strong&gt; Companies and individuals can be ruthless competitors. But they also cooperate regularly toward larger goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pragmatic – yet optimistic.&lt;/strong&gt; People realize that failures are inevitable. But they are also optimistic that any problem can eventually be solved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extrinsically motivated – yet intrinsically fulfilled.&lt;/strong&gt; People are motivated by money. However, their fulfillment comes from being recognized for their creativity and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with these characteristics, I present five suggestions in which leaders could improve academic culture, efficiency, and innovation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed up decision-making and eliminate bureaucracy.&lt;/strong&gt; Quick, agile decision-making instead of slow, methodical consensus-building will allow leaders to test hypotheses, learn about their organizations, and act swiftly. Tolerate zero bureaucracy if it hinders progress in areas that do not absolutely demand red tape. Clinical trials and patient safety require regulation, but making a new departmental website should take &amp;lt;24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand the institution as the people in it, and what they do.&lt;/strong&gt; If people value their work and colleagues more than the company, the organization has a fundamental identity crisis. University X is considered great not because it is an institution. It is great because of the people in it, and what they do. Make this a clear part of the culture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage “coopetition” by rewarding people with institutional wins.&lt;/strong&gt; Compensate employees with “virtual stock options” or institutionally available amenities. People should compete for personal benefit, yet realize their compensation depends on the success of their department or institution as a whole. Publicly recognize wins from faculty, staff, and students.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take controlled risks, and embrace learning from failure.&lt;/strong&gt; Failing, and failing fast, are a huge part of the culture. The VC community often backs entrepreneurs who have a history of failed businesses. Obviously, one does not seek failure in the setting of a life-saving operation. But academia should invest more in high-risk high-reward research and commercial ventures. Laboratory investigators often lack formal management training, and should thus work with or learn from professionals experienced in project management. Academic projects should incorporate faster cycle times, metrics acquisition, and learning from failure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make academia a meritocracy.&lt;/strong&gt; In Silicon Valley, people who are smart, talented, and work insanely hard will get ahead. Chris DiGiorgio notes that “in the Valley, your pedigree – family status, university or socioeconomic class – matters a lot less than your abilities, accomplishments and what you can contribute to the company. Academia should reward high-potential individuals with resources, authority, and compensation appropriate for their contributions, regardless of academic rank or standing. Firing bureaucrats who slow progress will improve work culture for all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While academic culture will take time to modernize, we can already start fostering the “startup spirit” among innovators
interested in medical technology and healthcare. Earlier this year, my colleagues and I founded &lt;a href=&quot;www.forgeatl.com&quot;&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt;.
We connect clinicians, engineers, business professionals, and students to accelerate development of healthcare startups.
This year, we have contributed to Atlanta’s innovation culture by hosting hackathons, meetups, and pitch competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe creating a successful startup culture in Atlanta will empower more people to advance healthcare innovation!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I prepared for Step 1 of the USMLE</title>

  &lt;li&gt;First Aid 2013&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USMLE-Rx qbank (hereby referred to as “rx”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USMLE World qbank (hereby referred to as “uworld”)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources-i-do-not-recommend&quot;&gt;Resources I DO NOT recommend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microbio made ridiculously simple – I didn’t like the text-heavy format. I could have just read First Aid, used flashcards, and done questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emory-specific: every module textbook except for Lily cardiology (First Aid and Wikipedia are sufficient to understand pathophysiology) are a waste of money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goljan is too dense and comprehensive; use Pathoma instead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Robbins &amp;amp; Cotran is even thicker than Goljan!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scheduling-emory-centric&quot;&gt;Scheduling (Emory-centric)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M2 ended on November 22nd, 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I took Step 1 on January 27th, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This gave me 65 days (9 weeks, 2 days) to prepare.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I took 8 days off to travel to California for a conference, see my family for the holidays, etc. This left me with 57 days (8 weeks, 1 day) to prepare.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Realistically, I studied 5 to 6 full days per week, and used 8 weeks. This was a perfect amount of time. Less would be insufficient, and more would leave me burnt out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To maintain balance and optimize long-term focus, I recommend regularly exercising, sleeping 6-8 hours a night, and maintaining some social activity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I divided my studying into &lt;em&gt;two phases&lt;/em&gt;: learning and question banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-phase&quot;&gt;1 – Learning phase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;33 days (4 weeks, 5 days), from 11/23/2013 to 1/5/2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I reviewed First Aid 2013 cover to cover for a second time. This was not the first time, because I used First Aid 2013 as the framework from which I chose topics to focus my studies on during the modules. I chose to ignore our provided syllabi in lieu of material that was guaranteed to be high yield. I did not fail any module exams, and scored well on NBME exams. I highly recommend this. If I could go back, I would skip more lectures, study more First Aid, and do Rx or Firecracker as I went through M1 and M2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each section took 2-4 days to complete.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I read the material, then did module-specific Rx questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I chose to learn with Rx (not UWorld) because Rx ties directly to First Aid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I only finished 40% of Rx; the goal was the reinforce learning of concepts via vignettes, not completion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My strongest sections: GI, pulmonology, psych.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My weakest sections: microbiology, pharmacology, EBM (because we learned it so long ago), cardiology, neurology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wish I spent less time on Learning and more time on QBanks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;qbanks-phase&quot;&gt;2 – QBanks phase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;22 days (3 weeks, 1 day), from 1/6/2014 to 1/27/2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every day, I did UWorld blocks of 46 questions on all random (every topic in First Aid) in tutorial mode.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I heavily annotated First Aid with colored pens and sticky notes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I left a dot next to the topic in First Aid so I would know which topics were heavily tested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most common topics on UWorld were EBM, HIV, hepatitis, antiviral drugs, diabetes, psych drug side effects, P450 modulators, alpha and beta blockers, heart murmurs, IBD, … will update list later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I eventually switched from tutorial to timed, do a block or two, then review the answers later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At first, it took me a day (8 hours of studying) to answer and review two 46-question blocks. I averaged ~60%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I improved my speed to four 46-question blocks (if I focused hard). My average score improved to &amp;gt;70%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I finished all 2200+ UWorld questions a few days before I sat for Step 1. I then reviewed the questions I got wrong. I highly recommend this. Completion of a qbank builds confidence, even if retention is not 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also took both UWorld diagnostic exams (blocks of 4 questions that give you a representative score). I am unsure if this was useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;test-day&quot;&gt;Test day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I took Step 1 at a ProMetric center 20 minutes east of Atlanta, in Tucker, GA. I chose this location because I assumed a suburban area would have less traffic and easier parking than downtown Atlanta.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I took a practice NBME exam at the test center a few days before Step 1. This helped me get a feel for the parking, building layout, security process, and computer system layout. I highly recommend this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On test day, I brought water, canned espresso, and snacks with complex carbohydrates and protein (banana bread graciously baked by an M3 friend, and mixed nuts with dried fruits).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I took two blocks of 46 questions, then a 5-10 minute break. I paced my caffeine intake and maintained hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I always finished every medical school exam and qbank block with time to spare, so I never worried about pacing. I usually finished a 46-question 60-minute block in about 45 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No matter how well-prepared, you will become mentally fatigued after the 5th straight block of 46 questions. Slow down, stretch, take deep breaths, and stay focused.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not forget to answer every single question, because guessing carries no penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
