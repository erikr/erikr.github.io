title: Startup reading
---

Reading does not make you a founder, much less a good one. But I like to read and learn. Here are some books, blogs, and Twitter feeds that talk about startups and/or healthcare entrepreneurship.

##Books

[The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408978222&sr=8-1&keywords=eric+ries): I'd start here. Eric's writing style is easy to read. He gives clear examples from real startups. You may have to think a little harder how to apply concepts from the tech and commerce world to healthcare, but you can do it!

[Zero to One](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408979907&sr=8-1&keywords=zero+to+one): By the famous Peter Thiel. Adding to what exists is 1 to n, but creating something new is 0 to 1. This book looks at monopolies, finishing second, culture, history, and more interesting aspects of "inventing the future". Because the book is a fleshed-out compilation of lecture notes, it lacks the rigor and detail of a full text, but it is absolutely entertaining and worth the read.

[The Four Steps to the Epiphany](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1408978229&sr=8-3&keywords=steve+blank): Steve Blank is a legend. No introduction needed.

[Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408978324&sr=8-1&keywords=daniel+kahneman): Ties in to FlashPoint (see further down). Psychology and behavioral economics is a framework to understand human interactions. Almost any work worthy of a Nobel Prize is worth at least knowing about. Sometimes it is even relevant to what you do in a novel way. This may be very true for Kahneman and startups.

[The Principles of Product Development Flow](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1935401009/ref=as_sl_pd_tf_lc?tag=reinertassoci-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=1935401009&adid=0BW47TC1EFJTKYXDY1D4&&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Freinertsenassociates.com%2Fbooks%2F): My dad is much smarter than I am, so I have yet to fully grasp the statistics, economics, and engineering concepts in this book. Value often arises from applying rigorous principles in new ways. I suspect I will appreciate these insights and applications in my own work when I am further in my career.

##Blogs

[Flashpoint blog](http://flashpoint.gatech.edu/blog/): FlashPoint is the coolest startup accelerator. Merrick let me shadow through their last batch, and I learned a lot. Actually, Flashpoint is not exactly an accelerator. They teach you how to look at the world with much more clarity, drawing on some work by Daniel Kahneman and other experts in behavioral decision theory, economics, and psychology. It is very hard to describe, but I think the process Merrick and his colleagues are developing is more sophisticated and insightful compared to anything else in the field.

[Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html): He is is a programmer, venture capitalist, and essayist. Notably, he co-founded Y Combinator.

[Bioentrepreneur](http://www.nature.com/bioent/index.html): This portal, hosted by Nature Biotechnology, is for scientists interested in commercializing their research. It is obviously industry-academia / biotech-focused, but recently they have covered startups more.

[Steve Blank's blog](http://steveblank.com/): Steve blogs a lot too. If you are interested in healthcare startups, I recommend you apple-F and look for his "Life Sciences" and "Lean Launchpad" posts.

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): Y Combinator's "reddit for hackers".

[Life Science Nation](http://blog.lifesciencenation.com/): this blog is capital / investor / market-focused, and has a lot of information.
