People sometimes ask "how's it going?". You can think of the reply in three dimensions.

Dimension one is "level of detail". Is the person an acquaintance, a colleague, or a close friend?

Dimension two is "domains to cover", which might include business, relationships, family life, hobbies, or spiritual matters.

Dimension three is the "delta" between now and when you last updated this person. This can be difficult to remember. You can quickly see how the simple task of catching up can be rather burdensome. I would much rather share my Gantt chart / project status list instead of write a long response. Unfortunately, the former is rude but the latter is socially acceptable.

If life is one massive repository with a complex web of stories forking in and out, sharing updates should be as simple as sharing a log of commits. Too bad people are not software projects. The world is not digital. Or is it?

My generation lives a digital life. Social media and cloud "life" infrastructure powers everything we do. People mirror their digital avatars on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Meetings are scheduled via online calendars, and we communicate primarily via texts, IMs, and emails.

We control our online presence. Personal websites, blogs, or sites like about.me allow you to consolidate and catalog your adventure through life. Blogging stands out as a worthwhile endeavor, but not because one wishes to win the arms race of self-gratifying online presence. Blogging is worthwhile because writing is important for at least three reasons beyond just sharing your content.

First, writing forces you reflect on your thoughts. I suspect the quality of thoughts follow a power law where most are useless and few are precious. Ranking the quality of your thoughts before you share them can be useful.

Second, writing is a common medium by which we convey information. Improvement requires conscious effort, but also practice. Becoming a better writer is a worthy endeavor.

Third, writing (online) can save you time because content is easily sharable and semi-permanent. Frequently asked questions, or "FAQs", are always in written form. If you notice you send the same emails or write the same memos over and over, make it a blog post and share that link.

When someone asks me "how's it going?", I won't send them a link to a blog post. That would be rude. But cataloging one's progress in life can reduce the magnitude of the three dimensions. People will Google you, and ideally find content you control. Thus, blogging and maintaining an online presence can help you spend less time on your reply, and more time on the real reason why they asked about you: human connection.
