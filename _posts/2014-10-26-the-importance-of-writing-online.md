title: The importance of writing (online)
---

People sometimes ask "how's it going?". You can think of the reply in three dimensions.

Consider dimension one as "level of detail". Even if you are introspective, crafting a response requires cognitive bandwidth. First, you have to quickly decide how detailed to make your response. Is the person an acquaintance? A close friend?

Dimension two is "domains to cover". You have to select which domains of your life to cover. This might include business stuff, relationships, family life, hobbies, or spiritual matters.

Consider "delta" as dimension three. Next you need to mentally track what you discussed when you last updated this person, and calculate what changed since then. You can quickly see how the simple task of catching up can be rather burdensome. I would much rather share my Gantt chart / project status list instead of write a long response. Unfortunately, the former is rude, and the latter is socially acceptable.

If life is one massive repository with a complex web of stories forking in and out, sharing updates should be as simple as sharing a log of commits. Too bad people are not software projects. The world is not digital. Or is it?

My generation lives a digital life. Social media and cloud "life" infrastructure powers everything we do. People mirror their digital avatars on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Meetings are scheduled via online calendars, and we communicate primarily via texts, IMs, and emails.

We control our online presence. Personal websites, blogs, or sites like about.me allow you to consolidate and catalog your adventure through life. Blogging stands out as a worthwhile endeavor, but not because one wishes to win the arms race of self-gratifying online presence. Blogging is worthwhile because writing is important for at least three reasons beyond just sharing your content.

First, writing forces you reflect on your thoughts. I suspect the quality of thoughts follow a power law where most are useless and few are precious. Ranking the quality of your thoughts before you share them can be useful.

Second, writing is a common medium by which we convey information. Improvement requires conscious effort, but also practice. Becoming a better writer is a worthy endeavor.

Third, writing (online) can save you time because content is easily sharable and semi-permanent. Frequently asked questions, or "FAQs", are always in the form of writing. If you notice you send the same emails or write the same memos over and over, make it a blog post and share that link.

When people ask you "how's it going?", I won't send them a link to this blog post (or any other). That would be rude. But cataloging your progress in life can reduce the magnitude of the three dimensions, because people will sometimes Google you and read your content. It can help you spend less time on your reply, and more time on the real reason why they asked about you: human connection.
