This year I did not enter the residency match after applying to research-track anesthesiology programs.

Several factors limited where I applied: interests, significant other, and geography. I am interested in academic programs that foster my interests in machine learning, cardiovascular monitoring, and critical care. My fiancée, a dental student at UCSF, applied to orthodontics residency as an international student, which is intensely competitive. Medical and dental residency applicants cannot couples match together. We prefer the West Coast or Northeast.
 
I applied to UCSF, Stanford, UW, UCLA, Cornell, Columbia, MGH, Brigham, and Beth Israel. I interviewed at UW, UCLA, Cornell, and Columbia. Later, my fiancée matched to Boston University. I am very proud of her for this significant accomplishment. Unfortunately, MGH, Brigham, and Beth Israel did not offer me interviews.
 
After four years of being in a long-distance relationship, we were tired of time zone mismatches, FaceTime calls, and long plane flights. Thus I decided to not enter the match, and will move with my fiancée to Boston in July.

I am excited to join the vibrant academic environment of Boston as a postdoctoral research fellow. However, I have grown to love the patient care, teaching, and breadth of research in academic medicine, and hope to later apply to residency.
