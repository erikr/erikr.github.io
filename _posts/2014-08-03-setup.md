##Hardware:
I think quality tools you use all day, every day are worth every dollar. Great tools make your work joyful. Apple products do this for me, although they cost a lot of money.

+ [15" Macbook Pro Retina](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/): I purchased a lightly used 2012 MBPr for $1450 off eBay. This was the best money I ever spent. The MBPr has a great balance of portability, computing power, and display awesomeness. 
+ [Keyboard cover](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FL6100/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1): this washable cover prevents your keyboard from getting smudged over time.
+ [Incase Sling Sleeve Deluxe](http://goincase.com/shop/incase-sling-sleeve-deluxe-for-macbook-pro-15): carries just what I need (MBPr, iPad, moleskine notebook, pens, papers) in a slim form factor.
+ [iPhone 5S](https://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/): I went iOS over Android due to the superior medical app ecosystem, and prevalence of iMessage among my friends. Plus, I really like the aesthetics of iOS 7, and app integration with OS X.
+ [Dell UltraSharp 2408WFP 24" monitor](http://www.cnet.com/products/dell-ultrasharp-2408wfp/): Having at least one large external display is essential for the technical academic: helps productive coding, manuscript writing, reading, etc.

Pro tip from [mattmight](http://www.twitter.com/mattmight): Buy multiple laptop chargers. Leave one at your office, one at home, etc. It can actually [make economic sense](http://matt.might.net/articles/artificial-scarcity/) if the cost of packing up your charger exceeds the cost of buying another one.

##Terminal tools & modifications:
+ [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): TotalTerminal is a great plugin for Terminal.app. Make a full-screen Terminal pop up with a custom hotkey combo.
+ [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized): a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications.

Pimp your terminal using [@jgmalcolm's](http://www.twitter.com/jgmalcolm) config files. This will align text in readable columns, and add color. Open Terminal, cd into your *repos* folder (you need GitHub installed), and enter these commands:

    $ git clone git://github.com/jgmalcolm/config.git
    $ cd config
    $ ./update
    $ source ~/.bashrc

Finally, go to *gitconfig* in the newly created *config* folder and edit James' [user] name and email to your own.

##Text editors:
+ [Atom](http://atom.io): "A hackable text editor for the 21st Century", built by the talented wizards at GitHub. I like the tabs and customizability. Solarized Dark (see above) is easier on my eyes.
+ [Vim](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vim/): For the pros. I still suck with this.

##File uploading & collaborative programming:
+ [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en): for FTP and WEBDav
+ [GitHub](github.com): You can use either the terminal or the desktop app. If you [register with a .edu email address](https://education.github.com/), you can get a free upgrade to an academic account which enables private repos for collaborating.

##Note-taking, Scheduling, & Email:
+ [Notes.app](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Notes_(application)): Saves notes to the cloud, syncs between my phone and my laptop. When OS X El Capitan comes out, Notes.app will basically become Evernote. Can't wait.
+ [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/): It's just a sick to-do list with sublists. Also syncs between phone and laptop.
+ [Sunrise Calendar](http://sunrise.am): I like this more than Google Calendar or Calendar.app for OS X because it feels more responsive, adds icons based on meeting key words, and adds pictures of the other people on your calendar events.
+ [Inbox (iOS)](http://www.inbox.google.com/): For triaging emails. I wish you could swipe to delete like in Mailbox, but Mailbox unfortunately creates email subfolders which is annoying. Also, Inbox still doesn't sync with YOUR contact's pictures, only theirs if they have G+.
+ [Gmail (desktop)](www.gmail.com): For actually taking care of emails. Professor Might illustrates why Gmail is an optimum email client in [this great post](http://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/).

##Papers
+ [Mendeley](http://mendeley.com/): Mendeley is a free reference manager and academic social network. Make your own fully-searchable library in seconds, cite as you write, and read and annotate your PDFs on any device. Most importantly, you can sync references with your research team (especially in a shared manuscript .doc). ReadCube doesn't sync to cloud, manage your PDFs in subfolders, or support groups.

##Dream Setup
+ 12" Macbook (space gray).
+ Burberry briefcase.
+ Whatever the newest iPhone is.
+ A career where I can talk, think, and work with brilliant people (instead of staring my monitor all day) as we solve the world's greatest problems.
