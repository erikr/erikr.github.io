[Forge's](http://www.forgeatl.com) 3rd Salon took place at Technology Enterprise Park. Here is the [Storify](https://storify.com/ForgeATL/salon-3).

>Clinicians are frustrated by problems that require technological solutions. Engineers, entrepreneurs, and makers build cool stuff, but have no clue what problems are clinically relevant. Finally, it can be difficult to get all of these people in the same room at
the same time.

## Salons fix these problems in three key ways:

1. We highlight local innovation resources, centers, and institutions. At Salon 3, the VP of [CardioMEMS](http://www.sjm.com/cardiomems) gave a guest talk about his work. 
CardioMEMS was recently acquired by St. Jude Medical with an up-front investment of $60M and the exclusive option of acquiring the company
 for an additional $375M given the completion of certain commercialization milestones. Read more about it [here](http://jaycaplan.com/2010/09/14/cardiomems-an-earn-out-with-a-twist/).

2. Clinicians share unmet challenges in medicine and healthcare over 5-minute talks.

3. Engineers, entrepreneurs, and makers share cool new technologies over 5-minute talks.

Attendees always have a great time networking after the talks. If you show up, be sure to bring a full stack of business cards!
