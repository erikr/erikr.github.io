Good writing says more with fewer words.

Use active voice.

Avoid parentheses.

Use short, declarative sentences.

Use the Oxford comma.

Be specific; avoid pronouns.

Avoid weak words like "really", "very", and "stuff".

Don't say "I think" or "I believe". Just state your position.

Organize your writing by outlining the major ideas at the start, and summarizing your main points at the end.
