title: Types of informatics
---

Here is a simple overview of types of informatics in biomedicine.

[**Bioinformatics**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) is the application of software and information technology to study biological data. Application areas include genomics, modeling of biochemical reactions, and protein structure prediction. Progress in computing power and biological research has improved the clinical translatability of approaches previously reserved as research tools. For example, we can analyze genomic data of pathogenic microbes quickly enough to aid in clinical diagnoses<sup>1</sup>.

[**Health informatics**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics) is like the above, but applied to clinical medicine instead of biology. Application areas include predictive analytics, clinical decision support, and electronic medical records. This field is also called clinical informatics or health IT, although the latter is often enterprise-centric. A recent McKinsey report summarizes how healthcare is reaching full digitization of the entire enterprise, but new solutions must also be patient-centric<sup>2</sup>.

[**Digital health**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health) is often interchangeable with health informatics. If someone in Silicon Valley mentions digital health, they often mean wearables and/or mobile health ("mHealth"), which leverages the ubiquity of smartphones (or other sensors measuring information about the body), the power of cloud computing, and wireless internet connectivity. [My lab](http://gdclifford.info) focuses on this field. Patients generate data that we analyze using machine learning and signal processing techniques, which reveal insights hidden from the clinician's naked eye. Rock Health has some great reports summarizing trends in this field<sup>3</sup>.
