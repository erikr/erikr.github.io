The American Physician Scientists Association 10th annual meeting featured a Policy Panel with leaders in device development, entrepreneurship, and FDA/governmental oversight:

* **Martin Burke, DO** - Professor of Medicine and Director of the Heart Rhythm Center, University of Chicago
* **Larissa Lapteva, MD, MHS** – Medical Officer, Rare Diseases Program, Office of New Drugs, CDER, FDA
* **Lex Van Der Ploeg, PhD** – Chief Science Officer, Rhythm

I asked the following question via Facebook:

>What can academic institutions do to encourage a culture of technology commercialization? How can students explore these opportunities while still honing rigorous basic science skills during their PhD?

The panelists answered:

1. **Martin Burke:** Training investigators to be able to effectively communicate the idea to those in the technology transfer office at their institution and be able to negotiate the next steps. However, there is often difficulty in developing personal relationships with those working in the technology transfer office due to high turnover rate. The easiest route to more familiarize oneself is through a mentor who has significant experience dealing with technology transfer, whether that is your own mentor or finding someone outside of your immediate laboratory personnel.
2. **Lex Van Der Ploeg:** Thinking ahead about how to develop a product while doing the research. One way is through mentoring from the technology transfer office, which can be achieved by asking them to be involved in your research team.
3. **Larissa Laptera:** At the governmental policy level, try to promote collaborations between researchers, technology transfer businesses, and industry for pre-competitive space that focuses on outcomes and endpoints.

Student Thoughts:

1. Consider working with your graduate student body leadership to advocate for a research commercialization course, where they can cover topics such as the process of getting a patent submitted to when it is approved, negotiations, what the technology transfer will need from you, and how they can be involved early in the research process in terms of considerations you need when designing experiments so if results are positive they can be taken to the next step more easily. This has been achieved at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC).
2. Consider asking your technology transfer office to link with bioscience business programs that offer seminars and webinars where students can earn a certificate after participating.
3. Consider asking a faculty with significant experience dealing with technology transfer to be on your thesis committee and specifically ask them to provide that perspective regarding the design and implementation of your experiments and extracurriculars available locally and nationally to become more familiar with the technology transfer process.
4. Many technology transfer offices hire postdocs and so consider talking with them to learn more about the kind of work they do and the internship possibilities during and right after graduate school.
