A16Z interviewed Kunle Olukotun, a professor at Stanford in the electrical engineering and computer science departments, about "IP in the open" [[link]](http://a16z.com/2014/10/23/intellectual-property-in-the-open/):

> Rather than locking down the resulting intellectual property, Stanford and Olukotun have taken the tack to make it widely available. This “IP in the Open” approach Olukotun argues, results in better solutions for industry and a faster uptake for new technologies and novel approaches.

This works when you have companies in an "affiliates program" that jointly fund academic research. Academics work on problems motivated by corporate backers.

IP is shared by these companies, who gain early access to IP before it becomes public domain. Sounds like the agreement grants sponsors the right of first refusal, although the deliverables are surely guided by commercial need.

Instead of individual faculty raising $ from companies, a consortium of faculty work together on a common research direction. This presents a larger effort which is attractive to corporate sponsors, and also improves collaboration.

This approach is exciting, and Professor Olukotun has a stellar track record of commercializing research. I am curious to know the explicit terms of ownership, royalties, etc. between Stanford, corporate backers, and the inventors. Stanford's Office of IP must do things a bit differently than other institutions; 'tis Silicon Valley, after all.

Gregoria and Shane ask this question in an interesting paper, ["Why do some universities generate more start-ups than others?"](http://iis-db.stanford.edu/evnts/4097/SShane_Why_More_Start-Ups.pdf).

> The results show that intellectual eminence, and the policies of making equity investments in TLO start-ups and maintaining a low inventor’s share of royalties increase new firm formation.

What do you think Offices of IP & Tech Transfer can do differently to improve startup success from academia?
