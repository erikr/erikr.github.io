title: Startup feedback - Quantified Care
tags: startups, mhealth
---

[QuantifiedCare](http://www.quantifiedcare.com/) is a new startup from Johns Hopkins University. They are an online store for digital health devices:

> Whether you are a physician, nurse, PA, home health care worker or any other clinician you can provide higher quality care by collecting more actionable and reimbursable data streams.

Some colleagues and I work on mHealth technology. Some of us have significant experience in the field. Also, I am close with one of the new QC members. We thought our feedback may be helpful to QC. Our thoughts are grouped into three main topics:

1. Business model
2. Culture change
3. Technical & clinical hurdles

**Thoughts on feedback:** Accept criticism and revise the product. Don't waste time responding to the post, tweet, or email. Fixing the problem that raised the criticism beats winning an online argument.

**We mean well with our criticism:** This is intended to be constructive, positive, and respectful. We respect the herculean effort required to launch a startup, and wish the founders much success.

### Business model

At first glance, QC appears to be a storefront, or warehouse distributor for mHealth devices. If so, they should act like a distributor and find partner hospitals or mobile care units who are willing to beta test new devices in a real healthcare system. If one small clinic at Hopkins does so, runs a trial, and reports improved care and lowered costs, QC would have leverage to expand.

If a hospital, mobile care unit, or global health unit wanted to adopt one of these devises, would they go though QC, or straight to the deceive manufacturer to reduce cost?

QC mentions "reimbursement" as a core part of CARE, but there is no information about how and how easily this happens with each product.

There is value in taking the guesswork out of which product to buy. However, it is not clear to me what the selling points are for each product. Why is it so awesome? What does it do better than the alternative?

Who is the customer? MDs? What type of MD? Mid-level providers? Empowered patients? This should be more clear.

What is the target market? Early adopters who already believe in these devices and want to find the best ones, or all doctors, even those who are mid- and late-adopters? If it is the latter, pure product won't do it. Education and training are also important.

----------

### Culture change

How ambitious will QC be in the bigger picture of mHealth and quantified medicine? Technology adoption will not be enabled by one company or organization. It will come as a result of a cultural shift. mHealth and QC devices must evolve from being "nice to haves", or "fancy" to "essential" for the practice of good medicine.

This cultural shift will come as the result of an ecosystem of changes. There will be foundations pushing for it, management organizations pushing for it, and individuals pushing for adoption, because of a focus on outcomes in care and on cost.

The potential upside, established brand name, and credibility for being early to the mHealth game is huge. However, to capitalize on that you need to play a huge part in three ways:

1. Education of the people as to why this is important
2. Identifying outcomes for using this technology
3. Disseminating best practices on how to use it.

They need partnerships (the Bill and Melindas of the medtech world), there need to be case studies of use, and, I think importantly, there have to be systems put in place for the management of all this information.

One such idea: an excellent offering, in my opinion, that will ease transition to mHealth technologies and simultaneously draw in the user, is a free-to-use, integrated platform, that centralizes all the user's patient data drawn from these devices and apps, monitors it, and provides a dashboard. If this could integrate with EMRs, I think there is a winner. There is a parallel trend in education with LMSs (Learning Management Systems, essentially the electronic medical records of the education world), which every school now needs, and the biggest selling point is: which and how many apps does your LMS integrate with? In fact, the biggest startup in education right now (Clever, IK12 '12 and YC '13), is solving that problem and that problem alone: they build APIs to get app X's data into LMS Y's system. That's all they do. Perhaps that information management angle is another angle to consider in the ecosystem of mHealth adoption.

### Marketing

QC is doing a good job avoiding the clichÃ© of "just another fitness wearables" startup. I like "serious" mHealth that focuses on improving clinical care, not just new fitbits.

From the name, description, and landing page, I didn't expect a "store" page. I expected information on what QC is, how I can use it, workflows, how it would improve my practice, how it integrates with existing technology and info management systems, and generally how it would benefit me. But QC is not a "thing" I use in any of those ways. It seems to be a storefront.

The transition from landing page to "store" is somewhat rough for me: why a store? Why are you trying to sell me all these very different devices? Which are entry-level? Which are more sophisticated? Which are high-use? And most importantly, why is this wrist cuff better than the one I already have and use? Does the patient need their own? Does it enable me to get data without a patient being in-office? Does it alert me when/if critical signs arise?

> At Quantified Care, we apply the CARE framework to evaluate and curate the best-in-class medical devices that sync with your smartphone or tablet.

The page talks about "how", but the bigger question in a culture-change effort is "why". Research suggests any gains from change need to be perceived as 2x higher than the status quo; [people are averse to risk and change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion). In healthcare and other bureaucratic systems, the benefit may need to be as high as 10x better. These benefits must be pyschological, not just economic. When providers cannot NOT have QC, then you will be good to go. [Merrick Furst coins this "authentic demand"](http://flashpoint.gatech.edu/jobs-you-cant-not-do/).

Generally I think the value prop of each product needs to be fleshed out, and the products categorized, rather than selling the value of being a "quantified physician" and buying all the devices. Right now the only selling point that jumps out at me is being hip and up-to-date.

If the products are to be sold in a system, I'd like to see information and examples of how they are integrated and managed, and case studies of how others have used them. If doctors are anything like teachers, this will help.

### Technical & clinical hurdles

The QC home page and store both do not focus on the strongest selling point of all digital health technology: data management.

Nobody cares that vital signs and other data are being sent to an iPhone. Well, maybe a few early adopters care about the potential it suggests. But there is nothing actionable here. No obvious cost-savings or outcomes-improvement. However, healthcare stakeholders are *very* interested in robust systems to store and access data. Imagine a cloud-based data warehouse that is compatible with iOS and Android.

Data management is software, not hardware. But mHealth hardware is useless without the backend if you want widespread utilization in healthcare systems. There are some difficult questions that QC is actually avoiding by not highlighting data, such as: where and how does the data get stored, should it be stored, for how long, and who is responsible for managing it? Who owns the data? What are they doing with it? Why should I trust them? What EMR are they using?

Frontend tech faces more subtle challenges. How skilled is the user? Just because they are an attending physician, doesn't mean s/he knows how to use all the equipment properly. This may seem silly because the app walks the user through each step, and the device is straightforward. But insufficient user proficiency is actually a challenge in the field of mobile health technology.

### Aside comparing edtech to medtech

We face many of the same issues in education. With the recent edtech boom, there have been mass moves to make new tech / training available to all schools, not just the well-resourced ones. Grants, foundations, and partnerships with community organizations and hardware manufacturers are all essential for massive distribution.

Are there grants available to hospitals, practitioners, or healthcare management orgs in rural and urban areas to staff this technology? Gates as well as many private firms sponsor these in edu. Further, are there discounts available for purchase in bulk? Apple, Google, and Microsoft all do this for iPads, Chromebooks, and tablets respectively. On occasion, teachers even band together (as part of an org) to purchase and get the discount. Could there be a similar effort for group practices? If so, that should be marketed.
