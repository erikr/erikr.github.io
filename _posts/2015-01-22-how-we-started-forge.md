title: How we started Forge
---

> This is the inaugaral blog post I wrote for Forge's new website.

To kick off 2015, I am excited to share Forge’s story, principles, and vision. I will also highlight five lessons we learned along the way.

Rewind to 2013: as a medical student interested in building new ways to help patients, I was not alone in Atlanta. My colleagues and I enjoyed meeting with residents, faculty, and young professionals to discuss technology innovation in medicine. Our gatherings were informal – a one-on-one for coffee, or a brunch over mutual interests.

One afternoon, a group of Biomedical Engineering students from Georgia Tech approached us. The engineers were starting capstone, a semester-long technical project, and wanted to meet clinicians for input. We offered to host a meeting, but realized we could take this idea to a higher level. In October 2013, we held “Medicine 2.0”, the first multidisciplinary brainstorming session at Emory University School of Medicine connecting clinicians with engineers and students from Georgia Tech. Medicine 2.0 was one of many gatherings that year that revealed massive interest in solving healthcare problems through technology. **Lesson 1 is about ambition**: anyone can catalyze large movements, as long as they keep their eyes open for opportunities, resources, and partners.

We hypothesized there was a nascent community of healthcare innovators in Atlanta. To learn more about this ecosystem, we tagged along with an executive team from Emory University through Flashpoint, the amazing startup accelerator at Georgia Tech. Our team had 200+ conversations with scientists, physicians, industry professionals, investors, etc. We discovered pockets of startup activity with relevance to healthcare, but this fledgling ecosystem was disorganized. We also learned many people are interested in healthcare entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, they do not believe Atlanta has adequate culture, resources, and opportunities to succeed in this space. **Lesson 2 is about perception**: what people do, or do not do, speaks louder than what they say they want to, or will do.

We believed our first hypothesis was reasonable, so we became interested in a new challenge: could we jump-start healthcare innovation by building a cohesive ecosystem? In early 2014, I co-founded Forge with Evan McClure, an MD/MBA student. Evan’s business interests, get-it-done work ethic, and ambitious vision is unique even among medical professionals. Together we recruited a team, organized events, and continued learning about healthcare startups. **Lesson 3 is about team growth**: include people that truly believe in your vision. Do not add people because you need help with the work. You will lower the quality, drive, and productivity of your team. You also will inevitably need to let people go, so minimize suboptimal hires from day one.

In the fall of 2014, Forge organized the first healthcare hackathon in Atlanta, and it was amazing. This was a turning point. After experiencing months of well-attended events and sponsorship interest, we felt the scarcity of resources available to healthcare startup founders was a tangible need we might fill. To better serve this goal, we incorporated as a non-profit organization, which enabled us to raise more funds and market ourselves with transparency and credibility. We also sought input from and partnerships with leaders from academia, industry, and the investment community. Many of them are excited to team up with Forge, and we are just as excited to work with the rich resources Atlanta offers to startup founders. **Lesson 4 is about ecosystem**: instead of reinventing the wheel, find a way to make it better. We want to make Atlanta’s healthcare community stronger, and care more about results than credit and ego.

Although barely a few weeks into 2015, Forge is already surging forward with new ideas, leaders, and partners. We will offer an enormous new hackathon, a series of content-rich bootcamps organized by Liz-Ann, and interactive salons thanks to Emily and her team. We have a fresh look with a redesigned logo and website. Our logo’s shape embodies our vision of improving healthcare through technology, while the orange color symbolizes energy, creativity, and determination. Expect more surprises too!

However, we must always focus on the signal instead of the noise. There is so much of the latter. Every week there is a new meetup, organization, or gala. But what is actually useful? We are often asked questions like “how many people attend your events?”, and “how much money have you raised?”. I consider these vanity metrics irrelevant in lieu of Forge’s real vision: to improve healthcare through technology. **Lesson 5 is about focus**: constantly debate, measure, and revise what actually matters. When a founder builds something that helps a single patient or a provider, the thousands of hours of work from our team will not feel like a donation. It will feel like an investment, and I am confident it will be among the best we ever make.

Our journey has taught us a lot, and hopefully provided value to our growing healthcare startup ecosystem. But our work has only begun. We boldly envision Atlanta as a destination for outstanding healthcare founders and investors. We invite you to join us as we invent the future of medicine.
