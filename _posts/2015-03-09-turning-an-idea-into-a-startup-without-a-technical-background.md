title: Turning an idea into a startup without a technical background
tags: startups
---

An undergraduate student recently asked me for help with a startup involving genomic technology. They filed a provisional patent, and were looking for an engineer and space to build a prototype. They were also thinking of finding a PI to be eligible to apply for SBIR or STTR funding. The student asked how to find resources necessary to develop the prototype.

My response was simple - find a technical co-founder. But my underlying concern extends beyond this.

Steve Blank believes [founders should know how to code](http://steveblank.com/2014/09/03/should-founders-know-how-to-code/), and many others agree. Now, some startups require little technical expertise, like [this idea for a packing box](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/05/er_student_shark_tank_update/campus.html). However, a startup involving sequencing, genomics, and nanopore technology requires expertise in genetics, electrical engineering, and computer science.

If you are a first-time founder and read stuff online, you may feel compelled to find MBAs, develop a marketing plan, look for space, incorporate as a legal entity, etc. However, none of those things are important even though they look fun and cool.

I told the student to focus on two things right now: 1) build the technology and 2) find your market by talking to users. Marc Andreessen wrote a [great article about product/market fit](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marc-andreessen-product-market-fit-startups-marc-andreessen).

I am concerned by the lack of a technical co-founder, prototype, domain expertise, or understanding of the customer. The concept is to uniquely identify individuals based on SNP profiles or something (I honestly do not know the details), but it remains to be seen how this can be done in a commercially useful and scalable fashion.

I notice a lot of young "wantrepreneurs" go through the motions of being a founder. These motivated young people are unaware of the shockingly low probability of success and unprepared to pay the true costs of success (skill, luck, time, psychology, etc.). I worry that hype paints false pictures of what a startup is. Startup culture celebrates failure, and pragmatism becomes warped by deceptive optimism. There is more noise than signal.

Young people are dropping out of school, raising other people's money and time, and diving into a side of the pool that is far too deep - when they could instead pursue other meaningful careers, and should focus on learning more about the world and how to be useful in it. Paul Graham writes on this in his post [before the startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html):

> In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat dangerous. If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers." It would set off alarms. Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that's actually essential: making something people want.
