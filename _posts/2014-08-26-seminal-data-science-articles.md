title: 38 seminal papers in data science
---

Data Science Central posted [a list of 38 articles every data scientist should read](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/30-seminal-articles-every-data-scientist-should-read?utm_content=buffer6caff&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).

They span topics such as random forests, machine learning, database structures, & data mining.

The external papers are downloadable in two clicks per each link, but I thought it more convenient for you to download all the PDFs in [one zipped folder](/assets/files/papers_datascience.zip).

*(One or two papers could not be downloaded...)*

Also, none of these papers are focused on big data for healthcare. I will post a compilation of those papers once I find, read, and vet the good ones.
