tags: research
---

Data Science Central posted [a list of 38 articles every data scientist should read](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/30-seminal-articles-every-data-scientist-should-read?utm_content=buffer6caff&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).

They cover topics such as random forests, machine learning, database structures, & data mining.

I zipped the PDFs I could find. [Download them here](/assets/papers_datascience.zip).

Also, none of these papers are focused on big data for healthcare. Once I find some good ones, I will post them.
