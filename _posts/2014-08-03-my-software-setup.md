title: My hardware and software setup
---

I am new to the magical world of Terminal / UNIX, software development, web design, etc. There are so many resources it can be hard to know where  to start. I will document my setup, resources, and journey. Hopefully you find this useful!

##Hardware:
*I think it is worth paying top dollar for tools you use most of your day, every day.  Make your work joyful. Apple products help this happen for me, although they cost a lot of money.*

+ [15" Macbook Pro with Retina Display (2012) - $1450](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): I purchased a lightly used baseline MBPr for $1450 off eBay - by far the best laptop I ever used. The MBPr has a great balance of portability, computing power, and display awesomeness. However, the battery life is sub-par. Later this year, Apple may be releasing a 12" Macbook Air with Retina, which will be a more ideal laptop for my needs. I installed the OS X Yosemite Public Beta (maybe unwise to do on one's primary machine), but so far so good.
+ [Keyboard cover - $10](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): this washable cover prevents your keyboard from getting smudged over time.
+ [Incase brief - $60](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): carries just what I need (MBPr, iPad, moleskine notebook, pens, papers) in a slim form factor. I would not buy a bigger or smaller bag. The material is not high-end, but neither is the price.
+ [iPhone 5S (space gray) - $650](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): I went iOS over Android due to the superior medical app ecosystem, and prevalence of iMessage among my friends. Plus, I really like the aesthetics of iOS 7, and app integration with OS X. This will only improve with OS X Yosemite.
+ [iPad Mini 2 - $400](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): This lets me quickly sketch concepts using []() and send image files. It is also a great PDF reader when I ride the shuttle between Emory & Tech, fly on the plane, or just want to read outside of my office. I wish I got 32GB memory though. 16GB fills up fast with lots of apps.
+ [Dell UFWP2401 24" monitor - $300](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): Having at least one large external display is essential for the technical academic: helps productive coding, manuscript writing, reading, etc.
+ **Pro tip from [mattmight](http://www.twitter.com/mattmight):** Buy multiple laptop chargers. Leave one at your office, one at home, etc. It is convenient if you are on the go with your machine, and can actually [make economic sense](blog link).

##Terminal tools:
+ [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/): TotalTerminal is a great plugin for Terminal.app. When I press caps + apple + c, a full-screen Terminal pops up. Thanks, [@jgmalcolm](http://www.twitter.com/jgmalcolm)!
+ [IR_Blank](http://toddwerth.com/2008/01/25/a-black-os-x-leopard-terminal-theme-that-is-actually-readable/): a black OS X terminal theme with colors to improve readability.
+ [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized): a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. Courtesy of [@yapatel525](http://www.twitter.com/yapatel525).
+ [Shell interface modifications](github.com/jgmalcolm): Aligns terminal output in readable columns, as well as nice colors. Thanks, [@jgmalcolm](http://www.twitter.com/jgmalcolm)!

##Text editors:
+ [Atom](http://atom.io): "A hackable text editor for the 21st Century", built by the talented wizards at GitHub. I like the tabs and customizability. I use Solarized Dark (see above) because I find it easier on the eyes.

##File uploading & collaborative programming:
+ [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en): for FTP and WEBDav
+ [GitHub](github.com): You can use either the terminal or the desktop app. If you [register with a .edu email address](https://education.github.com/), you can get a free upgrade to an academic account which enables private repos for collaborating.

##Note-taking, Scheduling, & Email:
+ [EverNote](https://evernote.com/): Saves notes to the cloud, syncs between all my devices, and lets me drop almost any document or picture in a note. I have folders for research, startup work, and medicine, with project subfolders within.
+ [Reminders](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4970): If I need to do something later, and cannot do it immediately, I add it to Reminders, which nicely syncs between all my devices.
+ [Sunrise Calendar](http://sunrise.am): I like this more than Google Calendar or Calendar.app for OS X because it feels more responsive, adds icons based on meeting key words ("dinner" has a little fork, knife, and plate), and adds pictures of the other people on your calendar events. Free for OS X and iOS.
+ [Mailbox (only for iOS)](http://www.mailboxapp.com/): I love this app for several reasons. Mailbox has a nice design. If you sign up, you get free Dropbox space. It lets you boomerang emails to handle later. A clean inbox (even with emails incoming later) is great for OCD people. If you achieve inbox 0, you get to see a nice picture! Finally, it only handles Gmail and iCloud. This helps me because I really dislike using my Exchange and Georgia Tech email. Because I prioritize my Gmail, users who contact my other email addresses receive negative feedback of delayed responses. That, plus replying to all emails from my Gmail account, plus a request to send future correspondence to Gmail, helps reduce unwanted emails to my other accounts.

##PDF management
+ [Mendeley](http://mendeley.com/): Mendeley is a free reference manager and academic social network. Make your own fully-searchable library in seconds, cite as you write, and read and annotate your PDFs on any device.
