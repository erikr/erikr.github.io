title: Set up data science stack on ERISOne
---

ERISOne is a "computing cluster with a job scheduling system for batch jobs, remote desktops for graphical applications and GPUs running on a Linux OS" maintained by Partners Healthcare.

Ideally, users do not need to purchase and maintain compute workstations. Rather, we use Macbooks to connect to a cluster behind the Partners firewall, This is ideal for working on a shared data repository, especially since we analyze PHI.

Unfortunately, setting up a modern data science stack on ERISOne is challenging. Many software packages are old, and obtaining desired memory, GPU, and CPU resources on a compute node requires additional steps.

This guide walks you through setup of Zsh, git, and more. It assumes you requested and have an ERISOne account, and connect via SSH ([see RISC guide here](https://rc.partners.org/kb/article/2814)).

> Follow the steps in order. For example, you should install `git` before `oh-my-zsh` because the commands for `oh-my-zsh` require a recent version of `git`.

## Install `zsh` shell

ERISOne comes with `zsh` 4.3.11, but the current version is 5.8. Users lack root access on ERISOne and cannot install `zsh` via `yum`.

> Note: you may need to first install `ncurses` from source.

This means we have to install `zsh` from source:

```bash
curl -L https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/zsh/zsh/5.8/zsh-5.8.tar.xz > zsh.tar.xz

tar xf zsh.tar.xz

cd zsh

./configure --prefix="$HOME/local" \
CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include" \
LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/local/lib"

make -j && make install
```

Now that `zsh` is installed, let's change our default logging shell. However, users on ERISOne do not have root, and thus cannot use `chsh`.

Add the following to `.bash_profile`:

```
export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
export SHELL=`which zsh`
[ -f "$SHELL" ] && exec "$SHELL" -l
```

`source ~.bash_profile` to make the changes take effect. Now `zsh` will be activated each time you log in to ERISOne.

The next time you log in, you will be prompted to set up the `zsh` shell. The prompt should look different:

```zsh
[ab123@eris1n3]~% 
```

Delete source files from your home directory:
```zsh
[ab123@eris1n3]~% rm -rf ~/zsh*
```

If you log out and back in, your shell should look much improved:

## Load `git`, `tmux`, & `vim` via `module`

ERISOne has `git` 1.7.1 by default, which was released in 2010. Subsequent installation of `oh-my-zsh` involves a shell script that invokes `-c` in `git clone`, which was introduced in `git` 1.7.7. Thus, we must upgrade `git`.

You can install `git` from source, but there are many other dependencies, so doing this would take a lot of effort.

Instead we can get a sufficiently recent (albeit not most current) version of `git` using the `load` command of `module`:

```zsh
module load git/2.17.0
```

Check if a more recent version of `MODULE_NAME` is available via `module avail MODULE_NAME`.

My `.zshrc` loads newer versions of `git`, `tmux`, and `vim`.

## Install Anaconda

The newest version of Anaconda on ERISOne (via `module`) is `4.4.0-p3`, whereas the current Linux version is `4.8.3`. Ideally, one would use the existing Anaconda module on ERISOne and set up a new environment with the desired Python version and packages. Unfortunately, there is an error with older versions of Conda that prevents users from even creating new environments:

```
RemoveError: 'setuptools' is a dependency of conda and cannot be removed from conda's operating environment.
```

To set up the desired Python environment, install Miniconda following the instructions in my [Linux setup post](../linux-setup). 

Like most Linux machines, ERISOne uses the bash shell by default. Therefore Conda will modify `/.bashrc` with the appropriate path for you to call `conda`. However, only `/.bash_profile` is called when you log in to ERISOne.

To ensure Conda is on your path so you can call `conda`, source `/.bashrc` in `/.bash_profile`:

```bash
echo 'export source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

After you install Anaconda, log out, and log back in ERISOne, your command line prompt should reflect that you are now using the base environment:

```bash
(base) -bash-4.1$ 
```
Don't forget to delete the Anaconda installer.

## Interactive session on compute node

Request a compute node on `interact-big` instead of running jobs on the login nodes (`eris1n2` or `eris1n3`):


```zsh
bsub -q interact-big -Is -XF -n 4 $HOME/local/bin/zsh
```
