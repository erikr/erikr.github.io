title: Announcing the 1st Life Sciences I-Corps Program at GaTech
---

Are you a student or faculty member in healthcare or the life sciences interested in commercializing your technology? This Fall, get ready to apply for a Life Sciences Regional I-Corps Program at Georgia Tech, organized by your friendly neighborhood VentureLab.

Last December I attended the final pitches of UCSF’s Lean Launchpad for Life Sciences & Healthcare, run by Steve Blank. I was blown away by how much progress the teams made in just a few weeks. The evening reinforced my belief that customer discovery, business acumen, and entrepreneurial spirit could transform innovation in academic medicine. My new mission was clear: to bring the Lean LaunchPad for Life Sciences back to Atlanta, where we have amazing substrate for medical innovation with Emory & Georgia Tech.

My friend Jenny, a postdoctoral fellow and entrepreneur in the course, helped me snag Steve’s phone number. I called him, explained how awesome the Lean Launchpad concept was, and shared how Atlanta was perfect for it. His response – “Yeah, let’s do it! Let me know how I can help” – was refreshing, and so … Silicon Valley. I was used to academic administrators and faculty telling me reasons why my idea was not feasible. He directed me to Keith McGreggor, director of GT’s VentureLab and NSF iCorps instructor.

We had a chat with Harold Solomon (friend, mentor, and Forge supporter), as well as Ravi Bellamkonda, Professor and Chair of BME at Georgia Tech. Everyone loved the idea. In fact, they were already considering something similar, given the explosion of entrepreneurial interest in healthcare. Actually, I didn’t do much except remind them how awesome this could be. And now it’s happening this fall.
