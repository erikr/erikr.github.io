title: Should you even found a startup?
tags: startups
---

An undergraduate student recently asked me for advice on a startup involving genomic technology. They filed a provisional patent, and were looking for an engineer and space to build a prototype. They were also thinking of finding a PI to be eligible to apply for SBIR or STTR funding. The student asked how to find resources necessary to develop the prototype.

My response was simple - find a technical co-founder. But my underlying concern extends beyond this.

Technical startups should have a technical (co-)founder. Steve Blank believes [founders should know how to code](http://steveblank.com/2014/09/03/should-founders-know-how-to-code/) this among many others. Now, some startups require little technical expertise, like [this idea for a packing box](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/05/er_student_shark_tank_update/campus.html). However, a startup involving sequencing, genomics, and nanopore technology requires knowledge of genetics, electrical engineering, and computer science.

If a technical startup lacks technical talent, it can be hard to attract funding, advising, or early employees. I am concerned by the lack of a PI, technical co-founder, prototype, domain expertise, or understanding of the customer. Does the technology even exist?

Spend your time iterating towards product-market fit, not going through the motions of running a startup. As Sam Altman says, ["The Y Combinator version of focus is â€œwrite code and talk to users."](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-things-get-done). Do things that bring you closer to product-market fit. In fact, Marc Andreessen believes [product-market fit is all that matters](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marc-andreessen-product-market-fit-startups-marc-andreessen):

> Whenever you see a successful startup, you see one that has reached product/market fit

However, many new founders spend time on stuff ASIDE from iterating towards product-market fit. They feel compelled to find MBAs, develop a marketing plan, look for space, incorporate as a legal entity, etc. Even though these things look and feel cool, pretending to run a company gets in the way of building a great company.

I notice a lot of young "wantrepreneurs" go through these motions of being a founder. These motivated young people are unaware of the shockingly low probability of success and unprepared to pay the true costs of success (skill, luck, time, psychology, etc.). I worry that hype paints false pictures of what a startup is. Startup culture celebrates failure, and pragmatism becomes warped by deceptive optimism. There is more noise than signal.

Young people are dropping out of school, raising other people's money, and diving into a side of the pool that is far too deep - when they could instead pursue other meaningful careers. They probably should first focus on learning more about the world and how to be useful in it. Paul Graham writes on this in his post [before the startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html):

> In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat dangerous. If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers." It would set off alarms. Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that's actually essential: making something people want.

I remind myself every day to focus on learn real skills, solve important problems, and meet smart people. Reading TechCrunch and being an armchair founder is easier, but nothing worthwhile was easy.
