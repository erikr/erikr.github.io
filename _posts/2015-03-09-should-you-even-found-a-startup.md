title: Should you even found a startup?
tags: startups
---

An undergraduate student recently asked me for advice on a startup involving genomic technology. They filed a provisional patent, and were looking for an engineer and space to build a prototype. They were also thinking of finding a PI to be eligible to apply for SBIR or STTR funding. The student asked how to find resources necessary to develop the prototype.

My response was simple: find a technical co-founder and focus on product-market fit instead of other distractions.

Technical startups should have a technical (co-)founder. Steve Blank believes [founders should know how to code](http://steveblank.com/2014/09/03/should-founders-know-how-to-code/) this among many others. Now, some startups require little technical expertise, like [this idea for a packing box](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/05/er_student_shark_tank_update/campus.html). However, a startup involving sequencing, genomics, and nanopore technology requires knowledge of genetics, electrical engineering, and computer science.

If a technical startup lacks technical talent, it can be hard to attract funding, advising, or early employees. I am concerned by the lack of a PI, technical co-founder, prototype, domain expertise, or understanding of the customer. Does the technology even exist?

Founders should iterate towards product-market fit, not go through the motions of running a startup. As Sam Altman says, ["The Y Combinator version of focus is â€œwrite code and talk to users."](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-things-get-done). In fact, Marc Andreessen believes [product-market fit is all that matters](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marc-andreessen-product-market-fit-startups-marc-andreessen):

> Whenever you see a successful startup, you see one that has reached product/market fit...

However, many new founders spend time on other things that look and feel cool. They feel compelled to find MBAs, develop a marketing plan, look for space, incorporate as a legal entity, etc. Unfortunately, these things are not directly in servce of building a great company.

I notice a lot of wantrepreneurs go through these motions of being a founder. I worry that hype paints an inaccurate picture of startups. Ambitious young people drop out of school, raise other people's money, and dive into a side of the pool that is far too deep. University start-up programs generally have no idea what they are doing, and can even hurt student's career opportunities. People should probably spend more time learning about the world and how to be useful in it. Paul Graham writes about this in his post ["before the startup"](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html):

> Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that's actually essential: making something people want.

Every day I have to force myself to learn real skills, solve important problems, and meet smart people. It takes discipline to do this instead of reading TechCrunch and trying to be a part-time founder. The latter feels easy and fun. But anything worthwhile tends to be insanely difficult and demands pure focus.
