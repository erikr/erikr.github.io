John Doerr, legendary VC at KPCB, held a great Q&A session at UC Berkeley.

> We looked back on our investments and found **five key factors** that distinguish the Amazons and Googles from the rest of the pack:

1. Technical excellence[^1].
2. Outstanding founders and management.
3. Strategic focus on a large market.
4. Fast execution.
5. Reasonable financing[^2].

Doerr also shares a framework for making career decisions:

+ Look for opportunity to learn and grow - not just compensation.
+ Build a strong foundation of experiences (sell and launch a product, manage 12+ employees).
+ Always network - develop personal, lifelong networks (sustain mentors, build confidence to cold-call).
+ Get in on the ground floor of high growth - Intel in '74, Google in '01...
+ Talented, experienced leaders are always in high demand.
+ Culture matters - put the mission before everything else.

[^1]: Critical for attracting top technical talent.
[^2]: Don't raise too much or too little money. Profit doesn't come from cutting a tough deal with your investors. It comes from being ruthlessly honest about the risk of your venture, and quickly reducing that risk. If you do that, follow-on investments are much easier to get.
