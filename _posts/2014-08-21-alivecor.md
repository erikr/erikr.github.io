title: AliveCor mobile ECG reviews

The [AliveCor](http://www.alivecor.com/home) turns your iPhone or Android phone into an ECG.

The device rests on your fingers or chest to record your electrocardiogram (ECG). It then sends the info to your smartphone via an ultrasonic signal which is picked up by your phone's microphone.

You can send your recording to a board-certified cardiologist or your personal physician.

Because the device is only a single lead, it cannot detect ischemic events or structural problems.

AliveCor's AFib Dector algorithm was approved by the FDA on 8/21/14 ([source](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alivecor-receives-first-fda-clearance-to-detect-a-serious-heart-condition-in-an-ecg-on-a-mobile-device-272134511.html)).

#Reviews

[@ShivGaglani](https://twitter.com/ShivGaglani), an MD/MBA student and entrepreneur at Hopkins, wrote an [interesting review](http://www.cardiosource.org/News-Media/Publications/CardioSource-World-News/2013/January/Health-Tech-iPhone-ECG-Review.aspx) of the AliveCor based on personal use.

> ...they have had an "incredible" diagnostic yield with the iPhone ECG, explaining that they "diagnosed ventricular tachycardia in a previously asymptomatic 35-year old man; a new case of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in a 41-year old man, who is now being ablated; paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in a 20-year-old college athlete who had been blown off by her coaches; and atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia in a 17-year-old congenital heart patient who was not diagnosed after a 2-week Holter study."

Anecdotes like these are hard to believe. But anything new and great is initially dismissed by skeptics, and several VCs are supporting AliveCor.

> Cardiologist Eric Topol, MD, often shares his compelling story of using a prototype device he happened to be carrying in his pocket to diagnose a fellow passenger on a transcontinental flight with an acute STEMI.

Without disprespect to the legendary Dr. Topol, this is diagnostically hyperbolic. Even if the patient has classic signs and symptoms of acute MI, along with elevated cardiac enzymes, you would still need a multi-lead ECG to truly determine ST segment changes.

[Leslie Saxon, MD](http://keck.usc.edu/en/Education/Academic_Department_and_Divisions/Department_of_Medicine/Our_Divisions/Division_of_Cardiovascular_Medicine/About_the_Division/Faculty_and_Staff/Leslie_Saxon.aspx) is the forward-thinking Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at USC. Read her article, [Ubiquitous Wireless ECG Recording: A Powerful Tool Physicians Should Embrace](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jce.12097/abstract), in the *Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology*.

Although the "study" was mostly subjective, qualitative self-reported use metrics, Dr. Saxon elaborates a compelling vision of a future where technology empowers patients. More information is better (when used wisely...). Giving patients more control and responsibility of their own information could improve awareness of their condition, and perhaps even improve outcomes.

Furthermore, technology-based solutions are scalable in an exponential fashion, unlike policy changes which either improve the allocation of existing clinical resources, or create new resources (slowly). Dr. Saxon believes this type of mHealth technology will allow a limited number of cardiologists (especially electrophysiologists) to interact with a larger number of patients.

Finally, the AliveCor system works off a fairly ubiquitous platform of mobile smartphones, which a large percentage of the US population uses all day, every day.

**So, is a single lead ECG good enough?**

Critics have attacked the AliveCor for only having one lead. Dr. Dave Albert ([@DrDave01](https://twitter.com/DrDave01)), the AliveCor co-founder, recently demonstrated a concept of a 12-lead version of the AliveCor:

> Rather than attaching 12 individual leads to the body, a clinician can obtain readings by pressing the single lead to each individual point of contact. Obviously, this requires clinical training and knowledge of where to obtain proper readings... ([source](http://www.mddionline.com/blog/devicetalk/alivecor-demos-concept-12-lead-mobile-ecg))

His study at USC demonstrated the AliveCor's ability to detect afib on par with a 12-lead ECG. However, it is not possible to accurately diagnosis ischemic changes using one lead. MIs occur in different parts of the heart, causing ST segment changes in different leads.

Potentially, you could pick up, rotate, and re-record at different angle from the main vector. But that solution obviously does not work in real-world practice. If the patient is completely motionless, it might be feasible.

I hope the team at AliveCor, or some other smart technologists figured out how to detect ST segment changes using such a compact form factor and user-friendly interface.

**What is next for AliveCor?**

[USC's Center for Body Computing](http://bodycomputing.squarespace.com/) is running a year-long [AliveCor usability study](http://bodycomputing.squarespace.com/alivecor-study/). My advisor and I are enrolled, and I received my AliveCor device a few weeks ago. We look forward to using it on friends and family.

I will use it to look for afib the next time see patients at free clinic, but I am hesitant to draw any other clinical conclusions from the device. *Disclaimer: medical students at our free clinics are always supervised by board-certified physicians.*

I also want to use it on the family dog when I am back in LA.

**Read about the basics of localizing MI based on EKG findings in this [PDF handout](/assets/files/ekgmi.pdf). I prefer 'K' to 'C' because of my name.**
