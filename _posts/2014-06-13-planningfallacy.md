title: Planning fallacy

>The planning fallacy is a tendency for people and organizations to underestimate how long they will need to complete a task, even when they have experience of similar tasks over-running.

[Forge](http://www.forgeatl.com) is planning the first-ever Healthcare Hackathon in Atlanta. Our first estimate of the budget was originally $20,000. The numbers seemed sound, and our estimates felt accurate. But making economic decisions off of "feelings" is dangerous. Having read [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402674266&sr=8-1&keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow), I realized we were probably committing the *planning fallacy*. I immediately increased our total budget request by 20%.

Historical precedent, from [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman)'s outstanding book:

* In July 1997, the proposed new Scottish Parliament building was estimated to cost up to £40 mil. By 1999, the budget was £109 mil. In April, legislators imposed a £195 mil. camp on costs. By 2001, the cost rose to 241. The story continues... the building was eventually completed in 2004 for £431 mil.
* In 90% of railway projects between 1969 and 1998, the number of passengers projected to use the system was overestimated, and the average cost overrun was 45%.
* In 2002, a survey of American homeowners who had remodeled their kitchen found on average they expected to pay $19,000. They ended up paying an average of $38,769.

To mitigate the planning fallacy, you can do three things:
1. Identify a reference class (e.g. UCLA and Stanford Hackathons).
2. Obtain enough info from those event planners to make a baseline cost prediction.
3. Adjust the prediction based on the specifics of our case (several experienced event planners in Atlanta told me to expect cost overruns above what we calculated).

As planning progressed, our budget is currently at ~$50,000, which is 2.5x our original estimate. We are incredibly excited to host this Hackathon, and the learning experience has been invaluable.
