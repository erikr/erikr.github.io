Non-parametric tests are also referred to as distribution-free tests, and are used when you *cannot make the assumption of normality*.

Non-parametric tests compare medians instead of means, and thus negate the influence of outliers (if there are only a few).

Here is a table comparing non-parametric tests to the usual parametric statistical tests, with Wikipedia links in some entries:

| Parametric test 						|	Non-parametric analogue	|
|---|---|
| One-sample t-test 					| Nothing comparable			|
| Paired sample t-test 				| [Wilcoxon t-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test)	|
| Independent samples t-test 	| [Mann-Whitney U test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test) 		|
| [Pearson correlation coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient)	| [Spearman's correlation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)	|
