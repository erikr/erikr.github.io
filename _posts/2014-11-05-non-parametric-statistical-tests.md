title: Non-parametric statistical tests
---

Non-parametric tests are also referred to as distribution-free tests, and are used when you *cannot make the assumption of normality*.

Non-parametric tests compare medians instead of means, and thus negate the influence of outliers (if there are only a few).

Here is a table comparing non-parametric tests to the usual parametric statistical tests:

| Parametric test 						|	Non-parametric analogue	|
|---|---|
| One-sample t-test 					| Nothing comparable			|
| Paired sample t-test 				| Wilcoxon t-test 				|
| Independent samples t-test 	| Mann-Whitney U-test 		|
| Pearson's correlation				| Spearman's correlation	|
