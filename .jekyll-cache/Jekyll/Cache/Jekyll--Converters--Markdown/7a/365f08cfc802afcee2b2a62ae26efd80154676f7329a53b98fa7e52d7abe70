I"ˆ<p>I aspire to be a great teacher of both medicine and engineering.</p>

<p>At Georgia Tech I TAâ€™d two semesters of computational systems biology. We covered linear algebra, differential equations, graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, and metabolomics. Here are my teaching evaluations from <a href="/assets/ta_eval_15.pdf">Fall 2015</a> and <a href="/assets/ta_eval_16.pdf">Spring 2016</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://erikreinertsen.com/tips-for-taing">â€œTips for TAingâ€</a> and <a href="https://erikreinertsen.com/give-a-great-chalk-talk/">â€œHow to give a great chalk talkâ€</a>.</p>

<p>At Emory I helped start the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2017/08000/Encouraging_Student_Interest_in_Teaching_Through_a.34.aspx">Medical Student Teaching Competition</a>.</p>

<p>At UCLA I tutored undergraduate engineering students for two years.</p>
