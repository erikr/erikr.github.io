Hello, I'm an M.D./Ph.D. student at Emory & Georgia Tech. Currently, I:

+ perform research in medical informatics, advised by [Gari Clifford, D.Phil.](http://gdclifford.info/gari.html).
+ study signal processing, machine learning, statistics, & behavioral economics.
+ am interested in interventional radiology and critical care.

Recent things I worked on (many as team efforts):

+ designed an M2 elective course: [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed/).
+ organized the first-ever [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com/).
+ performed clinical research on lymphedema & neuro-oncology.
+ co-founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a nonprofit that supports healthcare startups.

Before coming to Atlanta, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. In the lab, I performed research on biomaterials, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering, advised by [Benjamin Wu](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/Faculty/benjamin-m.-wu-d.d.s.-ph.d) and [Bill Tawil](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/bill-j.-tawil-ph.d). I did other stuff too (see my CV).
