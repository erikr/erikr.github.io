Hello! I'm an M.D./Ph.D. student at Emory & Georgia Tech advised by [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/gari). My [research interests](http://erikreinertsen.com/research) include machine learning, signal processing, mobile technology, and behavioral economics. Clinical applications include cardiology, psychiatry, infectious disease, and critical care.

Previously I:

+ founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a nonprofit that supports healthcare startups.
+ developed a [course](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed/) on innovation & entrepreneurship.
+ organized the first [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com/).
+ published research in reconstructive surgery and neuro-oncology.
+ helped organize technical & leadership conferences for [KSEA](http://ksea.org/).

Before coming to Atlanta, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA where I worked in the [Wu / Tawil lab](http://wulab.seas.ucla.edu/) on cell delivery with fibrin biomaterials, and stem cell imaging using gold nanoparticles. I was adopted from South Korea, hence the Norwegian surname, and grew up in Southern California.
