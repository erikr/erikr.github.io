Hello, I'm an M.D./Ph.D. student at Emory & Georgia Tech. <br>
I am interested in how software, mobile, and cloud computing are transforming healthcare, and how to combine startup speed with academic rigor so data becomes actionable insight for our patients. Currently, I:

+ work on informatics and digital health, advised by [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/gari).
+ study machine learning, signal processing, and statistics.
+ read about behavioral economics and tech culture.

Recently I did some cool stuff with great colleagues and mentors:

+ founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a nonprofit that supports healthcare startups.
+ developed a course: [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed/).
+ organized the first [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com/).
+ published research in reconstructive surgery and neuro-oncology.

Before coming to Atlanta, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA where I worked on biomaterials and nanotechnology, advised by [Benjamin Wu](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/Faculty/benjamin-m.-wu-d.d.s.-ph.d) and [Bill Tawil](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/bill-j.-tawil-ph.d). I was adopted from South Korea, hence the Norwegian surname, and grew up in Southern California.
