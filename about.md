Hello, I'm an MD-PhD student at Emory & Georgia Tech. Currently, I:

+ work on clinical informatics, advised by [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/gari)
+ study [signal processing, machine learning, & data science.](http://www.bme.gatech.edu/research/system.shtml)
+ manage [Forge](http://forgeatl.com), Atlanta's healthcare startup community.
+ run a medical school course: [innovation & entrepreneurship in medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed/).

Before coming to Atlanta, I studied Bioengineering with an option in Chemical Engineering at UCLA. In the lab, I worked on biomaterials, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering, advised by [Benjamin Wu](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/Faculty/benjamin-m.-wu-d.d.s.-ph.d) and [Bill Tawil](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/bill-j.-tawil-ph.d).

I was also an [Emergency Medicine Research Associate](http://www.uclaemra.com/), and founded [ISPE @ UCLA](http://www.ispeucla.com/), the first campus organization for students pursuing careers in the life science and pharmaceutical industries.
