Hello, I'm an M.D./Ph.D. student at Emory & Georgia Tech. Currently I:

+ conduct digital health [research](http://erikreinertsen.com/research/), advised by [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/gari).
+ study biomedical engineering and computer science.
+ read about behavioral economics and startups.

Previously I:

+ founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org) to support healthcare startups.
+ developed a [course](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed/) on innovation & entrepreneurship.
+ organized the first [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com/).
+ published research in reconstructive surgery and neuro-oncology.

I also regularly organize conferences for the [Korean-American Scientists and Engineers Association](http://ksea.org/). Before coming to Atlanta, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA where I conducted research on cell delivery in fibrin biomaterials, and stem cell imaging using gold nanoparticles. I was adopted from South Korea, hence the Norwegian surname, and grew up in Southern California. In my spare time, I enjoy working.
