Hello, I'm an M.D./Ph.D. student at Emory & Georgia Tech. I believe software is revolutionizing healthcare. Currently, I:

+ perform clinical informatics research, advised by [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/gari).
+ study machine learning, statistics, signal processing, and & behavioral economics.
+ manage [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a nonprofit that powers Atlanta's healthcare startup community.

Recent things I did (with talented colleagues and mentors):

+ designed an M2 elective course: [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed/).
+ organized the first-ever [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com/).
+ performed clinical research on lymphedema & neuro-oncology.

Before coming to Atlanta, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. In the lab, I performed research on biomaterials, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering, advised by [Benjamin Wu](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/Faculty/benjamin-m.-wu-d.d.s.-ph.d) and [Bill Tawil](http://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/bill-j.-tawil-ph.d). I also did a bunch of other stuff, so see my CV. I was adopted from South Korea, hence the Norwegian surname, and grew up in Southern California.
