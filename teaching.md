I TA computational systems biology at Georgia Tech. We cover linear algebra, differential equations, network and graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, metabolomics, and personalized medicine.

I manage [Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed), an elective course I created at Emory University School of Medicine offered every fall.

Finally, I founded the annual [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com) at Emory University School of Medicine.
