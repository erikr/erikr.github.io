I help teach computational systems biology at Georgia Tech. We cover linear algebra, differential equations, graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, metabolomics, & personalized medicine.

I created [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed), an elective course at Emory. 

I also co-founded the annual [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com) at Emory.
