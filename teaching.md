I am involved in several teaching activities.

I founded and run [Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed), a elective course offered during fall semester for second-year medical students at Emory University School of Medicine.

This semester I am a graduate teaching assistant for BMED 3520, a junior undergraduate engineering course on computational systems biology at Georgia Tech. We cover linear algebra, differential equations, network and graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, metabolomics and genomics, and personalized medicine.

Finally, I founded and help organize the annual [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com) at Emory University School of Medicine.
