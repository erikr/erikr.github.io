I founded and run [Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed), an elective course for second-year medical students at Emory University School of Medicine.

This semester I am a graduate teaching assistant for a computational systems biology course at Georgia Tech. We cover linear algebra, differential equations, network and graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, metabolomics, genomics, and personalized medicine.

Finally, I founded and help organize the annual [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com) at Emory University School of Medicine.
