I help teach computational systems biology at Georgia Tech. We cover linear algebra, differential equations, graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, metabolomics, & personalized medicine.

At Emory University School of Medicine, I occasionally help with our Evidence-Based Medicine course. I also co-founded our annual [Medical Student Teaching Competition](http://emorymstc.com).

Every year I give advice to several medical and graduate school applicants.
