The [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) works on signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling to reduce costs, increase accuracy, and improve access in healthcare using enormous, high frequency, and multivariate data streams.

Clinical applications include cardiovascular health, infectious disease epidemiology, sepsis and critical care medicine, sleep and mental health, etc.

 I analyze mobile device data using tools from time series analysis, graph theory, and machine learning. Currently I am focused on detecting epidemic outbreaks through cell phone data.
