The [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) works on signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling to reduce costs, increase accuracy, and improve access in healthcare using high frequency multivariate data streams.

Our theoretical developments focus on building confidence intervals and trust metrics for predictive algorithms and scaling analysis of medical data beyond conventional clinical capacity, particularly through mHealth.

Application areas include critical care, sleep and circadian rhythms, perinatal monitoring, and resource-constrained environments such as developing countries.

My research concerns the analysis of smartphone and medical sensor data using signal processing and machine learning. Currently I work on detecting epidemic outbreaks through cell phone data (co-advised by [Ymir Vigfusson](http://www.ymsir.com)).
