The [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) works on signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling to reduce costs, increase accuracy, and improve access in healthcare using enormous, high frequency, and multivariate data streams.

Clinical applications include cardiovascular health, infectious disease epidemiology, sepsis and critical care medicine, sleep and mental health, etc.

My research concerns the analysis of smartphone and medical sensor data using signal processing and machine learning. Currently I work on detecting epidemic outbreaks through cell phone data (co-advised by [Ymir Vigfusson](http://www.ymsir.com)).
