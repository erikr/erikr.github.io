I work in the [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory University School of Medicine.

I analyze phone & wearable device data using signal processing & machine learning.

Projects include:

+ Predicting infectious disease outbreaks from cell phone metadata (co-advised by [Ymir Vigfusson](http://www.ymsir.com)).
+ Classifying subgroups and predicting status changes of mental and cardiovascular illness from actigraphy and wearable ECG data.
