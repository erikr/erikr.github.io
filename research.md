I work in the [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory University School of Medicine.

I analyze phone & wearable device data using signal processing & machine learning. My goal is to quantify, monitor, and predict disease using scalable computational analysis of objective biomarkers.

+ Classifying subgroups and predicting status changes of mental and cardiovascular illness from actigraphy and wearable ECG data.
