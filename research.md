I am a postdoc at Mass General, MIT, and the Broad Institute. My advisors are [Aaron Aguirre][aa] and [Collin Stultz][cs].

We develop deep learning approaches to:
* Predict outcomes from 12-lead ECGs
* Phenotype decompensation of critically ill patients from physiological wave forms

I am affiliated with:
* [Cardiovascular Research Center, Mass General][cvrc]  
* [Center for Systems Biology, Mass General][csb]  
* [ML4CVD, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard][broad]  
* [Research Laboratory for Electronics, MIT][rle]  

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech. I worked on signal processing and machine learning applied to time series data from wearable devices. My advisors were [Gari Clifford][gc], [Shamim Nemati][sn], and [Amit Shah][as].

Prior to my MD/PhD training, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth. My advisors were Bill Tawil and Benjamin Wu.

My papers are available at [Google Scholar][scholar].
