The [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) works on signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling.

Application areas include critical care, sleep and circadian rhythms, perinatal monitoring, and resource-constrained environments such as developing countries.

My research concerns the analysis of smartphone and medical sensor data using signal processing and machine learning. Currently I work on detecting epidemic outbreaks through cell phone data (co-advised by [Ymir Vigfusson](http://www.ymsir.com)).
