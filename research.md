I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital (with a secondary appointment at MIT). My advisors are [Aaron Aguirre](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10465), [Brandon Westover](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/84202), and [Collin Stultz](http://imes.mit.edu/people/faculty/stultz-collin/). We develop machine learning approaches for phenotyping and adverse event prediction. Application areas are cardiology and critical care. 

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari), [Shamim Nemati](http://nematilab.info/people/shamim/index.html), and [Amit Shah](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#AJSHAH3). We extracted features from heart rate and accelerometer data using signal processing, estimated illness from these features with machine learning, and improved performance by analyzing information during specific times, over several time scales, and between signals. Application areas included sepsis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, mental illness, and neurodegeneration.
