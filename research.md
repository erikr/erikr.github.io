The [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) works on signal processing, machine learning, and physiological modeling to reduce costs, increase accuracy, and improve access in healthcare using enormous, high frequency, and multivariate data streams.

Clinical applications include cardiovascular health, infectious disease epidemiology, sepsis and critical care medicine, sleep and mental health, etc.

I work on:

+ Predicting onset of influenza H1N1 using mobile phone data.
+ Monitoring functional status of CHF patients via wearable devices.
