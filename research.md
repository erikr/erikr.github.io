I work in the [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info) at Emory & GaTech.

I analyze phone & wearable device data using signal processing & machine learning.

Projects include:

+ Predicting epidemic outbreaks from cell phone metadata<br>
(co-advised by [Ymir Vigfusson](http://www.ymsir.com)).
+ Classifying subclusters of mental illness from actigraphy<br>
and cardiovascular biomarker data.
