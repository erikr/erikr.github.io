I advise Healthcare Innovation Fellows at the [Healthcare Transformation Lab, Mass General][htl] on projects leveraging machine learning, informatics, and wearable devices to monitor patient physiology, lower costs, and improve outcomes.  

In 2018 I interned at [Takeda Ventures](http://takedaventures.com), an early-stage venture capital firm within Takeda Pharmaceuticals. I worked with Senior Partner [David Shaywitz, MD, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-shaywitz-md-phd-232a237/). We evaluated investment opportunities in startups that use data science and technology to discover, assess, or deliver impactful new treatments for patients. 

In 2014 I co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. In 2016 Forge merged with Sling Health, a biomedical technology incubator ([see blog post](http://erikreinertsen.com/forge-merger-sling-health/)).

At Emory I created an elective course for medical students on [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine][iemed] and ran it for two years.

At UCLA I founded and led a chapter of the [International Society for Pharmaceutical
Engineering](http://www.ispeucla.com/). We were the first organization to provide students with career opportunities in biotechnology and pharma.
