## Venture capital

I work at [Takeda Ventures, Inc.](http://takedaventures.com), an early-stage venture capital firm. I work with [David Shaywitz, MD, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-shaywitz-md-phd-232a237/), our Senior Partner who leads the data science and tech practice.

We focus on the elusive middle ground between tech & life science, and identify and invest in grounded, implementation-focused tech-powered startups that can improve how impactful new treatments are discovered, evaluated, and delivered.

We are interested in solutions that:
+ Apply technology to a relevant pharma business problem. 
+ Have founders with deep domain expertise in tech and pharma. 
+ Focus on pragmatic implementation (vs tech development).

Some general investment categories we are looking at include:
+ Digital biology: target identification, lead generation, imaging.
+ Clinical evidence: siteless trials, data fusion, phenotyping.
+ Patient engagement: empowerment, education, digital tx. 

If any of the above applies to your work, please get in touch!

## Past activities

In 2014 I co-founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance with clinical pilots. In 2016 Forge merged with Sling Health, a biomedical technology incubator with a national presence ([see blog post](http://erikreinertsen.com/forge-merger-sling-health/)).

At Emory I created an elective course for medical students on [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/papers/iemed.pdf) and ran it for two years.

At UCLA I founded and led a chapter of the [International Society for Pharmaceutical
Engineering](http://www.ispeucla.com/). We were the first organization to provide students with career opportunities in biotechnology and pharma.
