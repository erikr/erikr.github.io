I co-founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a non-profit that funds digital health startups and helps them launch clinical pilots. We just began Founders Forum, a program through which we are supporting five teams of founders [(blog post here)](http://forgehealth.org/2016/01/founders-forum-first-cohort/).

I also created and help run [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed), an elective course for 2nd-year medical students. We've done this twice so far.

*Founders working in digital health should feel free to contact me if I can be helpful. However, I only have time to try to help diverse and technically strong teams solving clinically important problems.*
