I co-founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a non-profit that funds digital health startups and helps them launch clinical pilots. We currently work with five startups [(read more here)](http://forgehealth.org/2016/01/founders-forum-first-cohort/).

I also created and help run [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/iemed), an elective that exposes 2nd-year medical students to tech. We've held this course twice so far.
