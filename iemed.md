###Course overview

Our goal is to expose medical students to topics and career opportunities in innovation and entrepreneurship.

Advances in technology - new vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutic devices - have revolutionized healthcare. New fields such as cloud and mobile computing are once more transforming how we help patients. Furthermore, health policy has shifted financial incentives and created new market opportunities for healthcare startups.

Physicians and medical students can become and/or work with startup founders. However, these opportunities are difficult to pursue due to clinical workload, cultural differences between tech and academia, etc. Furthermore, healthcare startups deal with regulation, complex financial systems, and a high cost of entry.

Despite these challenges, we envision a future where physicians engage in technology innovation and entrepreneurship to advance patient care. This elective exposes medical students to this vision.

###Ideas for next year

+ Provide more training on customer discovery
+ Have students form groups of 3 for performing customer discovery
+ Session on design and psychology related to identifying unmet clinical needs
+ Fewer unstructured panels from startup founders
+ Integrate students from PhD, MBA, JD, MPH, RN and other allied health programs
+ 90-minute sessions focused on interactive Q&A and problem-solving with invited mentors (e.g. [flipped classroom model](http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2012/10/03/using-the-flipped-classroom-model-to-re-imagine-medical-education/))
