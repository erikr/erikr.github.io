title: Reflections on IEMed elective

Class size inversely scales with logistical difficulty. Duh.
Be considerate of the M2s. Remember when we were in their position and how much material we had to study. I try to schedule things at 1pm, after lunch, but before 3pm small group. If they have Monday or Friday off, don't schedule classes then. Start and end on time. etc.
Given the limited duration and weekly time commitment by everyone, set realistic expectations for course goals. Next year I will cut the breadth of content by 25% to make more room for customer discovery and pitches.
LOs are a decent mechanism to organize content.
Show, don't tell. For many disciplines, I think lectures are inferior to demos, hands-on activities, or experiences. Students in my course talk to potential customers and stakeholders to learn more about unmet clinical needs. For your course, it would be very cool to bring rasberry Pis, arduinos, oculus rift, demos into the class instead of on powerpoint slides.
I used Gmail, Drive, Googel Cal, and my website (erikreinertsen.com/iemed/) to organize the schedule and materials. I can't actually think of any other way to do it. Blackboard is not only awful, but we may not get admin / lecturer access.
