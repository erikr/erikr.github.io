Set this up as problem -> solution

Use real examples

Volunteer orgs, nonprofits,

Lots of people putting in little time

Few people do too much

What have I tried to fix this?

Document the problems

Flood of emails

Too many people CC'd on emails

Wrong person on email

Navy uses Purpose - Discussion - Action formats for emails

Unfortunately, academics like to save the conclusion for the end

If you have a 20 person team, and everyone votes on the flyer design, then every email has to go to every person

Better: just give power to the event planner and graphic designer. Then emails only go to 2 people.

Over-emails and long meetings = sign of poor management and organization

Minimize role redundancy, maximize specificity
