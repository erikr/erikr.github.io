Buy-in from people you lead is dynamic and evolves over time.

If there is a threat your organization faces, and you need to take quick action before getting everyone's permission:
Communicate the threat
Take action
Protect your organization and make it clear your actions were to do so and not to further your own interest or harm anyone you lead
Core values already exist in large orgs, you don't create them. You have to listen, find, gain consensus around, clarify, and articulate them.

Five key principles of leadership:
Listen & learn
Diverse teams = maximum performance
Empower your team
Hire people who already bought in to your vision
People should be great solo, but even more amazing together
Don't restrict independence of amazing people
Management deals with complexity, while leadership deals with change
The best leaders do both
Plan transitions
Let everyone know you have arrived to serve them, not yourself
If you leave, make sure the organization endures
Finally, the best way to keep learning leadership is to read (form a group), get a coach, and obtain feedback.
