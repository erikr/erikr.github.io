title: My BME PhD qualifying exam
tags: academia
---

Here I describe my PhD qualifying exam format, questions asked, and general suggestions. Note this is n=1 from a single institution. Also note that BME is broad and the qualifying exam is tailored for a specific individual's coursework and research.

##Format

My committee consisted of one committee chair and two committee members. My advisor quietly & painfully observed.

The exam was supposed to be ~2 hours, but mine was much closer to 1 hour because the faculty were all late.

##Questions

Prior to the real questions, I was asked to introduce myself and my research in 5 minutes.

1. Explain what happens electrically when your heart beats. 
    1. Draw the ECG waveform.
	2. Explain how the ECG records electrical activity from the heart.
	3. Write an algorithm to determine heart rate from ECG data in real-time.
	4. What is the appropriate frequency to measure the QRS complex?
	5. Describe a different way of doing q1.3.
	6. How do you accomplish q1.3. in the presence of noise?
2. Tell me what you know about active transport of cargo inside of a cell.
	1. Describe the forces involved using an equation.
	2. What happens to the complex in the presence of charged molecules?
	3. Vesicles actually connect to the dynein-kinesin complex via a tether. How does this tether change your model?
3. Why is experimental design important?
	1. How many subjects do you need to do an experiment?
	2. Describe beta in the power calculation?
	3. What is the definition of false negative?
