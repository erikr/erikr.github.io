title: Should I build an app, or found a startup?

A question came to my mailbox recently:

>I have a really basic question for you. If you had to distill the steps for app development into a roadmap, would it sound something like this:
idea- mock up/protoype- obtain designer and developer- obtain seed funding to pay developer or pay in sweat equity- build product- solicit more start-up funding to establish company or license app to someone else- sell app

My question in response: is this a startup? Or just an app? Did someone say "hey if you build X, Y, and Z, I'll buy it?" Or is there a greater problem that must be solved? If the answer is the latter, here are things I think might be relevant.

The only thing that matters for a startup is product-market fit: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marc-andreessen-product-market-fit-startups-marc-andreessen

Here's another view; note several of these steps appear to be cyclical or parallel rather than linear:
Validate unmet need and market: something to do the ENTIRE time
Find a technical co-founder who shares your vision: easier than trying to motivate and communicate with outsourced hires; de-risks team substantially if you are looking for investors and more team members. That said, outsourcing is so cheap that you could pay for a nice mock-up to better convey your concept when you are co-founder dating.
Early revenue >> premature fundraising. Charge money for your product, even if it is early stage. The best way to get investors interested is to demonstrate you're already making money. http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/199/Startup-Reality-Distortion-Effect-1-Giving-Your-Software-Away-For-Free.aspx

This is perhaps more big-picture. I'll ask some software engineers and professional project managers for input on specifics.

Then, Frank replied:

If you just want to build the app, and you have a straightforward idea of what you want (I.e., you are the target market), then yes, the roadmap outlined will work fine. The hardest points will be getting a designer and developer, but my impression is that if you are developing this app for yourself and your self-market, you would rather hire contractors, and you probably don't want to manage a team, equity, etc. This line of development is also less likely to receive funding, and needs it less. It's also less likely to be a company.

The other path is the full-fledged "startup". However, most apps are developed to be an app and not a company. Some questions to help you decide which you want to be are:

1. Do I want to manage a team?
2. Do I foresee and/or desire my app to grow into a platform, and do I desire to support a user community?
3. Do I see further apps to be developed to form synergies with my current app?

If the answer to these questions is yes, then you probably want to start a company. This necessitates the points you echoed down below: invest your time in finding a likeminded technical cofounder who believes in your vision, and in identifying and speaking with people until you find someone who is ready to pay money for your app's service. The business is in supporting these people, and building further products, be they digital apps, physical products, or services, that add value to their lives.
