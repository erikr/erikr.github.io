title: Should I build an app, or found a startup?

If you just want to build the app, and you have a straightforward idea of what you want (I.e., you are the target market), then yes, the roadmap outlined will work fine. The hardest points will be getting a designer and developer, but my impression is that if you are developing this app for yourself and your self-market, you would rather hire contractors, and you probably don't want to manage a team, equity, etc. This line of development is also less likely to receive funding, and needs it less. It's also less likely to be a company.

The other path is the full-fledged "startup". However, most apps are developed to be an app and not a company. Some questions to help you decide which you want to be are:

1. Do I want to manage a team?
2. Do I foresee and/or desire my app to grow into a platform, and do I desire to support a user community?
3. Do I see further apps to be developed to form synergies with my current app?

If the answer to these questions is yes, then you probably want to start a company. This necessitates the points you echoed down below: invest your time in finding a likeminded technical cofounder who believes in your vision, and in identifying and speaking with people until you find someone who is ready to pay money for your app's service. The business is in supporting these people, and building further products, be they digital apps, physical products, or services, that add value to their lives.
