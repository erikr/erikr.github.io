##Summary

Your personal statement (PS) is an explanation for why you want to be a physician.

Michelangelo carved the statue of David by removing everything from a block of marble except the angel. This perspective is analogous to a good PS, which summarizes your fascinating journey through life up to today. What remains is your next step: an inevitable career in medicine.

Writing a PS is difficult because it demands introspection and brevity.

Here I outline a process for [brainstorming](#brainstorming), [writing](#writing), and [revising](#writing) the PS and also share some [dos](#dos) and [donts](#donts).

##Brainstorming

Explore as many concepts as possible. Go analog and use a blank sheet of paper or post-it notes. Travel down memory lane and write down every person, place, thing, event, or concept that felt important or memorable. Powerful memories usually have an accompanying emotion such as joy, loss, conviction, etc. Be broad and do not erase anything.

To help you get started, think about these questions:

+ Who are your important role models?
+ What made you curious about science, biology, math, physics, etc.?
+ What were your proudest and scariest moments in life?
+ Describe an experience with the healthcare system.
+ What makes you excited?

Next organize your raw material into **groups** based on theme or time. Each group should have a one-sentence summary. For example, one group could be "my summer experience building water restoration infrastructure in Guatemala".

Next gather 3-5 related groups into a **family**. Each family is a potential essay with one thesis sentence that links the summaries of the groups. A thesis might be "a lifelong passion for serving others with my gifts". Groups within this family could include volunteer experiences, or aspects of service and leadership in your research or clinical experiences.

Explore several essay ideas and see what tells your story best. Go with your gut. Writing a story that is authentically "you" is both better and easier than trying to guess what admissions committees want to read.
