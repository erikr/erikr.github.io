title: Reflections on the first Emory Medicine elective on innovation and entrepreneurship
---

###What was useful about this elective?

New perspectives on aspects of healthcare beyond just clinician

Exposed to other opportunities for Mds - venture capital was really interesting

Networking

Healthcare reform

Lots of talks about follow the money: driving force behind healthcare

How do you develop new ideas?

Learning more about resources at Emory and GT

MDs who didn't go into medicine = interesting to the students

Healthcare is like a machine, doctors make it run. And there is an entire industry around it that actually changes it.

We don't get that perspective in the regular curriculum

We learned about different aspects in healthcare - especially nurses

Many stakeholders in healthcare / teams



###What career paths didn't resonate?

Being an inventor / engineer. Can't develop things ourselves but can work with these people.

Harold's talk about customer discovery was confusing and too hi level

###How was working on the projects?

Fun but time constraints severe. Instead of individual, group projects are better. Go more in depth. Only talked to 10-15 ppl.

Unsure what next steps are beyond initial customer discovery

Updates = struggled to get through all of them. Fewer presentations.


> How do we move forward with ideas now that we know about opportunities to improve healthcare?

cultivate relationships with people who help you think differently

Challenge: how do you keep your head up when you are a busy attending?

Plug iemed in with Goizueta Healthcare Club

> Career paths: when do I do a side project?

Academia vs practicing clinician

Policy / big systems issues is a possible career path

Medical device / pharma

Innovation: private practice, or academia

Different ways to get in

Raj Gupta?
Dave Toshi - Upenn
Chris Niyashean - google ventures


###Suggestions

Have a talk on career opportunities for MDs

Article about what is VC

Primers on business terminology

90 min sessions vs 60 m

Lecture - open
Discussion over lunch - only elective students
